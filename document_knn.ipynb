       "               'text': 'Tips Every Freelance Content Writer Should Know \\n  Content creation rarely happens quickly. Even experienced writers rarely produce their best work on the first draft. They revise their work several times before getting their articles out the door. In fact, the best articles you read in prestigious magazines always get some help. Just like a diva looking ravishing on the red carpet after fashion stylists, make-up artists, and hair and nail experts have done their best to prep her, so does an excellent piece of writing benefit from different inputs before being published. The truth is that many famous bloggers and authors research and then write their drafts, but a skilled editor and proofreader always comes behind to wrap up their work and finish the process. Unfortunately, up to recently, most freelance writers couldn’t afford this luxury, and editing gets often overlooked. Hello, AI Writers. Table of Contents AI Writers To The Rescue Today there are AI writers and editing tools to assist you. However, consider how you want to use them to enhance your work. For example, ChatGPT can be used to brainstorm ideas for blog posts, videos, and other content. You can also use ChatGPT to assist with optimizing your content for search engines. A job once done by SEO experts is now available via AI writers. Primarily, you can conduct your topic research via AI writers and identify trends worth writing about and sources you can use to verify your findings. AI writers are not the be-all and end-all so ,you willmustrn how to edit. 4 Editing Tips You Should Use Here are four editing tips that every freelance content writer should know and use. 1. Avoid Empty Filler Words One of the biggest mistakes content writers make is that they pack a lot of information and ideas into one sentence. They use many empty filler words that add no real value to their content. Let’s look at a few sentences to exemplify this problem: “There are many people who misunderstand the words” AS OPPOSED TO “Many people misunderstand the words.” Or “It takes patience to build trust,” AS OPPOSED TO “Trust takes patience.” The words “it” and “there” followed by a form of the verb “to be” are called grammar expletives and they dilute the writing directedness. A good editor cuts the superfluous use of expletives and emphasizes the proper drivers in the sentence. 2. Avoid Weak Verbs Choosing the proper verbs can make your writing clearer, stronger, and more persuasive. A strong verb can paint a vivid picture in your readers’ minds. Consider the following sentence: “She was a fast runner.” That is a good sentence that can project a concrete image in your mind. Now, consider the more descriptive option “She flew like the wind as she speeded down the track.” You can easily imagine her racing, right? Content writers often use the verb “to be” in the first draft. The problem with “to be” verbs is that they can weaken the words that follow. The solution is to replace them with more powerful alternatives. For example, instead of “The weather was beautiful.” use “The sun shone brightly that day.” 3. Avoid Weak Adjectives Similar to verbs, adjectives can drain out the energy from your text. Savvy editors and content creators avoid using words like “very” and “really” before common adjectives. Some examples are: “Really bad” instead of “Excruciating.” “Really good” instead of “Excellent.” Or “Very common” instead of “Ordinary.” Taking “very” and “really” out of the equation is certainly a “great” thing, as is the use of strong alternatives. For example: Use “Thrilled” instead of “Happy.” Use “Filthy” instead of “Dirty.” Use “Delicious” instead of “Tasty.” You should use the most descriptive language to trigger the reader’s senses and help them imagine how things smell, sound, taste, and feel. 4. Know Your Punctuation You can be the best storyteller in the world. If you lack grammar skills, your mistakes will turn readers off. While an auto-correct program can quickly detect typos, more subtle errors can sneak into your text. The sparingly use of the comma is one of the most common punctuation mistakes most freelance content writers make. Here’s an example: “You can neglect editing, and the audience reading your text may not notice, but your ideas will be lost.” In case you didn’t notice, the missing comma between “editing” and “” suggest “means you can neglect the audience reading your text,” which is precisely the opposite of what you should do or intend, for that matter. Of course, if you read it again, you will realize the sentence’s meaning. But, if people need to go back to grasp what you’re saying, your ideas AND your audience will likely be lost. Conclusion Small changes in your writing can fuel enthusiasm and make people devour your post. It’s just a matter of finding the most potent and specific words.  If however, this really is too hard for you, there is always the content writer’s little helpers – AI writers!',\n",

In fact, most software has many more features than most users typically use. Liken the uptake to Pareto’s 80/20 rule where only 20% of the features are used. Imagine the lost opportunities when your marketing team are using so few features! This article looks at CRMs and how using more features helps optimize your content and digital marketing. Table of Contents What is CRM? What does it do? CRM stands for Customer Relationship Management, and it’s used to nurture consumer interactions and drive business success. Specifically, it helps you do the following: Identify profitable sales opportunities Store relevant prospect and buyer information Document service problems Oversee marketing campaigns, etc. A CRM helps you harmonize your management tasks for sales, marketing, and customer relationships, so what are some of its features? CRM features include: Contacts, leads, tasks and campaign management Sales data and analytics Dashboards and report generation Sales forecasting Marketing automation Content database Image repository library Mobile CRM, and more Are you using all these features? Plus, there are more tailored features in the industry-specific CRMs. Industry-specific CRM For example, there are automotive industry CRMs customized to meet dealerships’ unique lead management needs. Other industries also have customized CRMs, including: Healthcare Manufacturing eCommerce Legal Accounting Real Estate and more So the next question is – how can you use your CRM to optimize your content marketing campaigns? Optimizing Your Content Marketing Let’s have a look at what to do with a CRM to improve your content marketing success. 1. Refined Buyer Personas To Target Capture, store and organize customer information, i.e. buyer personas within your CRM. Using the data captured in the CRM, you can uncover insights on your customers through their actions and journeys. With this intel, you can create relevant content for your marketing campaigns that target specific customer demographics, i.e. your target audience. For example: How an automotive CRM connected to a car dealership’s blog can empower marketers. Site visitors read a particular blog post before visiting the 2021 Honda CR-V product page, requesting information or making a purchase! The automotive CRM confirmed the blog post had content on the five best cars for young professionals The CRM also confirmed the inquires and buyers of 2021 Honda CR-V were mostly in their late 20s Conclusion: No marketer hungry for insights will ignore information that tells them how to craft content for specific customer demographics. Refining your buyer persona is essential for doing less work with more resources. Analysis helps marketers create topics and content that truly appeals to targeted audiences. 2. Customer Segmentation CRM tools also help you sort your customers according to their demographics, interests, jobs, company sizes, industry, etc. Customer segmentation can also include pages on your site that customers visited and show their engagement. Engagement varies, and it’s a big topic; however you can set up and view metrics from time spent on site, the content viewed and conversions (sales). Customer segments can go further, too, assisting with your marketing content and their publication schedules. For example: A law firm uses a CRM to monitor its online client activities on its website. The CRM reveals visitors of various ages watching specific videos at different times as well. The legal office can categorize these visitors into, e.g.: 40-year-old couples viewing divorce-related video materials on late weeknights Aged 30-something professionals watching overviews on managing workplace conflict during weekday lunch breaks Middle-class residents consuming videos about land disputes every Sunday afternoon, etc. With this hyper-specific information, the law firm can easily determine the best content to create for which audience group on which days and times. This is advantageous, especially if you have a diverse clientele and suite of service offers. 3. The Customer Journey Not all website visitors immediately convert and buy your products and services. Some take time, but every consumer typically goes through a series of phases in their interaction with a business. Marketers call this the customer journey, which usually has the awareness, consideration, and purchase (or decision) stages. A CRM tool helps you determine and track your customers’ progress by extracting updated data from several sources and organizing prospects accordingly. Knowing prospects’ specific stages of their journey is crucial since each stage requires a unique set of marketing tactics to get their buy-in. This intel helps you develop relevant, targeted messages that resonate with your intended audience for your content marketing campaigns. For example: How an eCommerce retail shop sells herb-infused beverages. The CRM reports reveal how long it takes for a customer to purchase by measuring site activities. For example, the site visitor may read several blog posts, repeatedly visit the product page, and put items in carts — but later abandon the cart. The eCommerce retail shop can review the website content and sales strategy and conclude why the cart abandonment was how the invitation to buy was presented within the blog posts content. The blog topics were likely to be niche and relevant to site visitors who already know the product. For the visitors that need more steps in the buying process, e.g.choosing the best flavor for their nutritional needs or understanding garment sizing before adding a shirt to the cart, revise the content and sales process to include the extra step. Plus, remember to match your content appropriately with the stages of progress, including: Awareness: blog and social media posts, educational webinars, checklists, whitepapers, kits, tools, tip sheets, ebooks, how-to videos Consideration: free sample, case study, product comparison guide Decision: coupons, live demo, free trial, consultation offers 4. Repackaging High-Performing Content CRM reports will present data on the content and campaigns that yield optimal results. Leverage all insights when planning your content and reuse or repackage the material to engage your intended audience. Probe into your best-performing content according to the CRM insights. Check its compelling elements and apply the same for your next content pieces. Creating templates will be great when reusing the content. You can also repackage it in other forms. For instance, you can turn a case study into videos, infographics, webinars, blog posts, etc. Final Thoughts You can get a lot more from a CRM than just a data repository. Information is power, and in this blog post, we highlighted how using more features of your CRM can help you make your content marketing work harder for your business.',\n",

       "               'text': 'Is Your Content Authentic And Trustworthy? \\n   Is your content marketing authentic and trustworthy? Or is it regularly misused for advertising and sale pitches? This article shares insights on how your content marketing can engage customers, improve your brand, and increase website traffic and rank. First, rule out what you shouldn’t do with your content marketing. Table of Contents Avoid The Selling Trap Time is money, and content marketing incurs a lot of time. Plus, you’re dipping into your marketing budget if you’re using a third party, i.e., a copywriter, to create your blog posts and articles. However, this doesn’t afford you any leeway to add sales pitches. 🙂 The fastest way to disengage with customers and damage your credibility as a trusted advisor is to ‘blow your own trumpet’ overtly or attempt to disguise selling as something else of value in your content marketing content. All businesses need a sales strategy, including posts on platforms your customers frequent. For example, when you need to push a new product or promotion, be transparent and construct your advertisement in a campaign that lets your audience know you have something to share about your business, product, or service. Sneak in the sales pitch. In your email marketing posts on social media and your website, you can use long-form content like an ‘advertorial’ but call it what it is instead of using content marketing to ‘sneak in the sales pitch’ somewhere, hoping to fool your audience. An example of selling in a blog post is using an anchor like ‘click here’ for more information, and the linking page is to an online shop, not to more detail on the topic presented in the article’s content. Consumers only need to experience this insult to their intelligence once to leave them with a negative impression of your business. Maybe it’s not your fault as you or your marketing team were wrongly advised by a third party like a link builder. Or that you, as an outreach marketer, caved in when pressured by your client to get ‘do follow’ links to their home page. According to Google, did you know all sponsored links in content need to be identified as such? When accepting guest posts, publishers need to be vigilant and mark external links sponsored as sponsored, no, follow, or both. How to Create Content That’s Authentic Highly informative articles focusing on knowledge transfer don’t just work hard in the short term. They’re everlasting insofar as good content is always found in searches and shared. It’s this content that Google ranks highly, too, so wasting time with subterfuge actions that your customers are not fooled by is counterproductive. Start working on a long-term strategy for your content marketing with unique, relevant content that genuinely resonates with your audience. Write content that inspires you. When you’re writing your own content, it’s a lot more enjoyable when it’s on a topic that interests you. Your writing style will ooze your enthusiasm for the subject, keeping your readers engaged. External input from leading authorities. When searching for experts and articles on the same topic, the Internet is your best friend. Search online for keywords relating to your content topic to find out what has been written about it and consider how you can improve their message in your article. Always reference your sources in your content. Introduce facts, statistics, and opinions. All content should show you’ve done your research. Introduce results from surveys and studies and present data and statistics to support your content. Articles that are well-researched and written do take longer. The average article of 1000 words may take up to six hours. However, if you’re not up for writing 1000+ words, every post focuses on quality over quantity. There is no right or wrong answer for how how long a blog post will take, and you’ll never know when you finish it. If you’ve created that article, it will be stand-out and loved by all, including Google. Summing up Many marketers and some businesses are less interested in the long-term gain of content marketing: their content marketing style churns and burns their audience and brand reputation. Stop using short-term traditional marketing strategies for content marketing as it really needs a long-term approach. You can make an immediate impact when you avoid ‘selling’ in blogs, guest posts, and articles. Remember, hiding that you’re just promoting a service or product will fool no one.  Transparency and clear communication are the only way to get more from your content. Blogging is a topic we love, and there’s no end to what you can learn and do with it.

Use three proven strategies not once but all the time! This article focuses on three sure-fire actions you can take to get more traction with your existing and new content contributions. Your blog posts, articles, social media posts, videos, reviews, feedback, and more can work harder for you. The starting point is knowing actions to take and repeat to boost your SEO with your content. The following recommendations are in no particular order; all need your attention as and when required. Let’s start with analytics. Table of Contents Use Customer Journey Analytics Whether you’re using Google Analytics or a more advanced solution, focus on customer journey analytics which tells you much about your users. Deep analytics give you insights into what people like and don’t like. Consider it like having access to a built-in user survey without your readers having to answer a single question. On-page and bounce rates Your website will have pages that get the lion’s share of attention. Look at your website pages with the longest on-page time and lowest bounce rates in your analytics system. These ratings tell you what people are enjoying about your site content. With this information, you can hone in on what attracted users to the page and what is on it that holds their attention. If the page is an article – is it the title, the topic, or how it’s written, the layout using bullet points, headings, images, and videos. Does the page have a call to action, for example, a type of interactive content like a quiz or poll? Knowing how to interpret website analytics is visitor and customer feedback for your marketing campaigns without asking for it! However, capturing the data and learning how to get what you need from it is just the beginning you also need to use to improve your SEO and online performance. Write Click-Worthy Title Tags Google measures user-interaction signals for its ranking algorithm, including click-thru rate. The more clicks your website gets from Google, the more Google will boost your rankings. Click-worthy titles are priceless and serve as the introduction to your brand. First impressions can literally make or break your copy. Keyword Title Tag When drafting your title, develop title tags with a keyword to make it click-worthy. Boring titles do not attract users, and clickbait turns them off. Marketing is a value-based commodity; you do it right if your title draws readers in and your content keeps them engaged. Keywords are the magic words that connect you to readers. Using them in your title will ensure that your work is seen. Use descriptors Be concise and use descriptors. What are readers looking for in your content offers? Use descriptors that differ from existing content title tags so your titles stand out. Reveal Say what you’re offering. Your title is the first thing users see, so make it count. Tell them what they will get, i.e.,10 Healthiest Smoothies for Weight Loss. Original Make it unique, and spark curiosity. Make your title the unicorn in the field of horses. Ask yourself, what would make you stop and read this? Write For the Internet Since one user interaction signal that Google measures is dwell time, the longer someone stays on your article, the better it is for your SEO. Quality The quality of your content is the most crucial way to draw users to your brand. Then to capture users’ attention and keep it, you’ll need to make each word count, keep it concise and offer value. Originality What do you offer that is original and captivating? The element of surprise you offer will draw people toward your brand and keep them coming back. Offer solutions to customers’ everyday challenges, which keeps them engaged with your content. Structure So you need to write using short paragraphs of 1-3 sentences. And you need to break up the text with images, bullet points, and quote blocks to make the page more readable. As you develop content, make sure you write for keywords. Most people searching on Google are looking for answers to questions. Your articles will increase rankings if your content answers questions more succinctly and correctly than your competitors.  You can use these ideas to create helpful content for your readers while paying attention to keywords and interestingly offering answers to their questions. Internet writing is different from writing for print, so it may take a slight shift in mindset as you develop content. Most people do other things while they read, while some only skim through. When you can attract readers with fun, helpful content, there is a greater chance you will retain their focus and offer additional content that will keep them engaged in your brand. Step out and differentiate yourself from the herd of other content providers. Summary Keep it simple and follow these recommendations to get more traction with your content marketing campaigns.  Analytics are your best friend when you know how to read and put them to good use tweaking your content for higher conversion. Content provision is never accessible but a necessity.  Set goals and rewards when your campaigns show you’re heading in the right direction.',\n",

Today, one of the most impactful and positive things you can do for your site and its outreach is creating fantastic content that your growing audience can read, engage with and learn from. That being said, it can be pretty hard to precisely identify what exactly makes great content. How can you produce the right amount of valuable and shareable content? The unfortunate truth is that you can consistently produce a great flow of new and fresh content and still not get the conversion rate and organic traffic you are hoping for. The reason for that is typical because even though your content is excellent, it is not answering the needs of your audience. Table of Contents Why Your Blog Needs Top Quality Content Your content simply has to be the best, and It has to stand out compared to the competition. Perhaps most importantly, it has to strike a chord with the people reading it, and it typically takes quite a bit of research (but we’ll get to that later). If you are looking for ways to improve your content creation game, here are some tried and true tactics that you may want to consider. Tactics To Improve your Content Keep an eye on social media. You’re probably already pretty tuned in to the activity of your brand on major social media channels. If you’re not, you definitely should be! But that knowledge alone is not nearly enough. Make sure that you expand your attention to social media to capitalize on viral trends or issues that relate to your niche and business. You may be able to identify the very questions your audience merely has by paying closer attention to what conversations are being had on platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and more. Make sure you really know who you’re selling to You must keep in mind that your customers are more than just demographics with variable purchasing power at every stage of your business. When you are thinking of content that you want to specifically get your customers involved in, it is of the utmost importance to consider who they really are. Look at customer notes, comments and complaints to spark up inspiration for your latest content post. Another great way to get inside your customers’ heads is to offer customer questionnaires on your site. Ask them how they feel about your brand. Ask them how they think about your products or services. This will give you ample material to work with when creating content, but it will also help your customers feel more involved in the business and more heard. This will only help lead to greater customer loyalty. Don’t you think understanding your customer base is essential? Consider the research done by Invesp, which found that creating a compelling buyer persona can result in an increase in conversion by an incredible 238 per cent. Check out the competition. In the dog-eat-dog world of business today, there is nothing wrong with looking into where your competitors are succeeding compared to you by taking a look at what kind of content is getting great feedback on the site of your major competitors. You can do this in one of two ways. First off, you can simply look on their site and see what content is getting the majority of shares and responses. The other more in-depth way to figure out what is resonating on your competitor’s pages is by doing a competitor content audit. This will offer you a comprehensive look at what is working in your industry. It is precious information that you can use to improve your digital marketing strategy and your search engine optimization strategy. Another significant aspect of taking a look at your competition is to see what kind of social media influencers they are working with. While you may not want to straight-up poach influencers from your game, you can certainly see how they use influencers and take advantage of their outreach and followership. Research your keywords Indeed, keywords are not quite as impactful as they used to be when it comes to improving the outreach of your site and content (tactics like keyword stuffing are very much a thing of the past), but that does not mean that keywords no longer matter. They totally do! A great way to utilize keywords is to pick up your keyword research to see what people are talking about online, sharing and responding to. You can check keyword research tools such as this list here or just use ahrefs – or another keyword tool. Use essential keywords to think up great title ideas or combine different keywords to develop a great new topic for your blog. Don’t undermine the importance of your title It can be easy to overlook just how crucial a title to your articles are, but missing the first thing that a potential reader sees is a severe mistake. Even when you know exactly what you want to write and have some fantastic ideas about what topics you will cover, take a deep breath and spend 5-10 minutes really thinking about the title of your new work. Better yet, think about talking with some of your coworkers to see if they have any good ideas regarding a title. They might have a completely different approach that can improve the title and the content you are writing about. A title should be quick and concise, draw readers in but not be clickbait. It’s a balance, and with that extra time, you can indeed find that outstanding balance. Research, research, research You want to make engaging and informational content, and one of the best ways to make sure that you actually achieve that goal is to jampack your work with valuable information. Don’t just write two to three pages of puff that doesn’t even teach the reader anything. Another type of research that you want to do is find out what actually works when it comes to content creation. Back in 2017, Buzzsumo looked at 100 MILLION posts to find out what people tend to share and why. The results were incredibly useful when it comes to content creation. For the most part, longer content is more popular. Images are particularly critical to success, and people tend to share things that they are emotionally connected with rather than intellectually connected with. Believe it or not, the most common emotion linked with shareability was awe with 25 percent. The second most popular emotion was laughter was 17 percent. The second was Amusement with 15 percent. Believe it or not, considering what you hear about on the news, anger only took up six percent of shares on social media. It is never a bad idea to include some cold-hard facts in your content either. There is no need to turn your content into a PhD dissertation, but it certainly doesn’t hurt to back up some of your claims with factual information. Don’t forget to optimize So, you’ve done the necessary research and have put your blood, sweat and tears towards creating an exceptional piece of content that your customers will surely enjoy. You’re close to the finish line, but you’re not there yet! Now is the time to take the content you have written and make sure that you optimise your work before publishing by way of on-page search engine optimization. If your writing has a specific, overall focus, chances are you really already have the keywords and concepts necessary. Still, it is important to keep in mind the important SEO you want to keep in mind before you publish: Make sure your meta description is concise yet descriptive Make sure your sub-headers contain keywords and variants Link to authority sites that you have used to build out your content Link to internal pages that are related to the content to keep visitors engaged with your site Add images with descriptive alt text Incorporating visual media such as videos and slideshows is not necessary to the success of your content, but it can definitely help! It is also essential to keep in mind that there is simply no way to predict whether or not a bit of content that you create will be successful or not. Summary As hard as that may be to hear, no amount of hard work necessarily means your new creation is going to gain traction. That being said, if you consistently work to pump out well-written posts loaded with great information and insight, your audience will gradually grow. It will likely take patience – and it could take many months for you to really see the fruits of your labor, but those fruits will come! Content is, in many ways, the personality of your business. It not only gives your audience and customers something to read, but it also lets them know about you, your personality, your interests, and so much more. Don’t consider content just a simple transaction. Use it as a tool. Use it as a way to work out questions you are having within your own business practices. It can be gratifying in more ways than one. All you have to do is start writing!',\n",

You can only do so much in the day, yet your blogging to-do list could have you in front of your screen 24 hours a day. To be a successful blogger, you have to manage your time and be extremely organized. You’ll need to plan out your day, week and month to ensure that you are producing so your blog can grow. Burn out is very real when blogging and is the reason most fail at it. That, and not seeing results and feeling like your hard work is for nothing. In this article, I will go over some ways to be more productive so you can get more done in less time. You’ll enjoy the success you’re seeing from your blog and also the free time from your productivity. Table of Contents 1 – Time tracking To see where you need to be more efficient with your time, you have to know how you are spending your time working on your blog. Use a time tracker app to segment all of your tasks to see how much time you spend doing each. You may find that you are inefficient with your time. For instance, you should probably do certain tasks together and others at another time. When you’ve figured out how you’re spending your time working on the blog, then you know where you can be most productive, as you will see in the hacks coming up next. 2 – Outsource Let’s look at your content creation process. Let’s say that you spend 20% of your time researching a topic for your post. Then another 10% outlining your post. And 70% of your time writing it. This would suggest that you can do something about the writing segment to make your process faster. The best way is to hire a freelancer to take on some of the work. You could research and outline an article and then pass that on to a writer to create the content. If you find you spend a lot of time doing social media and not creating new content, you should look into hiring a social media manager to take on some of the work. 3 – Batch your work Suppose you are early in your blogging career and don’t have the budget to outsource. You can still do all of the work yourself if you use your time wisely. For instance, batching your work on certain days or certain times is a very efficient way to use your time. Using the same content creation example, you can set aside a day where you only do research. Fill up a spreadsheet with article ideas complete with all the keyword research and outline for each post. Then on another day, do the actual writing. When you do every task one at a time, it is grossly inefficient. Instead of researching, then outlining and then writing, you will find your workflow much smoother by doing each task all at once. 4 – Use your readers to generate content Getting free content is a great way to grow your blog while doing other tasks aside from writing. Having your readers make content for you is a fantastic way to do this. It can come in many forms. You can ask questions in your blog posts on the blog itself and encourage people to answer in the comments. This extra content is usually rich in keywords that can be picked up by Google. Another way is to ask people who have products that you are reviewing to make a short video about how they like the product. You can post the video on your site or make a Youtube channel for a traffic boost without making the videos yourself. 5 – Get some fresh air Spending too much time working on your blog will actually slow down your progress and limit your productivity. You need to get outside and go for a walk or run to get the blood flowing and get some fresh air. This will give you a much-needed energy boost to use when you get back to work on your blog. It can also help you think about things that can help you overcome something that might block your progress. Walking is a great way to clear the mind for problem-solving, so use the time for this instead of looking at a blank screen when you have a writer’s block.',\n",

       "               'text': '3 Content Tips For B2B Marketing  \\n  While content creation can be a challenge for many businesses, B2B businesses seem to have a tough time with content strategy and content creation. Because writing for a business’s decision-makers can be different from writing for a traditional consumer, many businesses writing B2B content struggle. But with the right planning and preparation done before you sit down to actually create any content, you will find just how easy it can be to create content for a B2B business. Table of Contents 3 Ways To Create B2B Content To show you just how this can be done, here are three tips for creating content for B2B marketing purposes and ensuring that that content connects with your target market. 1. Get To Know Your Audience With Personas Just like creating content for B2C businesses, B2B businesses should start by creating personas for the type of customers or clients they want. Not only will this make it easier for you to visualize who you’re creating your content for, but it can also help you narrow down the focus of your content. Solve problems According to Neil Patel, an online marketing guru, the buyer personas you create for B2B content should focus primarily on their problems or struggles and how you, as a business, will address those issues. Once you have this information nailed down, it will be much easier to develop content ideas that will help you fulfill both variables. For example, you can create content addressing the problems that your personas face and how using something like your products or services can show major improvement for their organization. Clearly articulate how your product or service solves your B2B customers’ problems or fulfills their needs. Focus on your unique value and how it aligns with their business objectives. Research and analyze customer data To help create personas, research and analyze your target B2B audience thoroughly. Understand their industry, pain points, goals, and decision-making process. To create buyer personas representing different segments within your audience, consider your existing customers’ benchmarks. Review the existing customer data and reach out to your customers to collect what you need to build your ideal buyer personas. 2. Browse Online For New Topics And Ideas Another way you can find great fodder for content ideas, according to Dan Shewan, a contributor to WordStream.com, is to see what people are talking about online.By tapping into current hot topics in your industry, you may find that your content has a further reach due to people being interested in consuming all they can about this issue or idea. To best do this, you must first know where your target market spends their time online. Once you can find them, getting involved in whatever online communities they’re in can be constructive so you can see what trending topics are being discussed. What you’re doing here is keeping up with conversations. With this information in hand, you can create content for your target personas relevant to you and your business and timely in that it addresses current concerns that people within your industry are dealing with. Personalize your content based on the recipient’s industry, role, challenges, etc. This can be done through targeted email campaigns, personalized landing pages, and relevant content suggestions. 3. Write Content That Adds Value If you’ve been creating content for quite a while, you might feel like you’ve completely maxed yourself out on new ideas. And while this might be partially true, there are always ways to look at things differently or come at an idea from a new angle to help you create an entirely new piece of content. To help you with this, Honey Singh, a contributor to Entrepreneur.com, recommends that you try to find a balance between posting content on a regular schedule that will help your content marketing and SEO efforts with only posting content that you feel adds real value. If this means posting fewer pieces of content, then so be it. Educate However, keep in mind that it’s important to remember that all the content you create for your target demographics should add some kind of value for them. B2B customers often appreciate content that educates them about industry trends, best practices, and emerging technologies. Create whitepapers, ebooks, webinars, and guides that showcase your expertise and provide valuable insights.  Use AI writers to assist you with your content. Every content should have a clear and relevant CTA that guides the reader to the next step in their journey, whether downloading an ebook, requesting a demo, or contacting your sales team. Use Evidence B2B customers are more likely to be swayed by data, statistics, and real-world evidence. To support your claims, incorporate case studies, success stories, customer testimonials, and industry benchmarks. Track the performance of your B2B content using relevant metrics like engagement rates, conversion rates, and lead generation. Analyze the data to identify what’s working and needs improvement, then optimize your content strategy accordingly. Remember that B2B customers are typically more rational and focused on ROI than B2C customers. Your marketing content should build trust, demonstrate expertise, and provide concrete value to help them make informed business decisions.',\n",

       "               'text': 'Content Marketing Ideas to Implement in 2022 \\n  The opportunity to invite change in your business and onboard new ideas will benefit the company. To do so needs careful analysis of every aspect of your business. One of the most important departments to focus your attention on is the marketing team. Marketing strategies that worked in a few years ago might not necessarily work as well now, so it is crucial to find new ideas to implement so that your business stays relevant, fresh, and, most importantly, competes well. The key is focusing on quality content for SEO. Here are some content marketing ideas that you can introduce to your team this year that will help you maintain success. Table of Contents Written content Backlinks If you aren’t already doing so, you need to implement a content marketing strategy that focuses on backlinks. In order to bring more traffic to your website, you need to improve your search ranking position on the SERPs. For many, the goal is to achieve that number one spot, or even better, position zero. Although the algorithms can often change, the more backlinks that you have, the more value it will add to your domain authority. However, it’s important to note that the content must be of high quality. Google will spot filler content that is not adding anything of value from a mile off. Therefore, you should make sure that, if you want Google to view your content positively, it must be of high quality. If this isn’t your strong suit, there are content writing services that can help you create high-quality content. Implement a successful link building marketing strategy, and Google will see that you are a company that people can trust, and therefore, your ranking on their search engine should improve. Top Tip: The more influence a site has, the more it will benefit you, so try to reach out to domains of high authority within Google. Blog on your site Creating content around backlinks works, but so does having content on your own website. If you’ve managed to bring the traffic to your site, that is one thing, but being able to keep and make sales is another thing. So, it is just as important to focus on the content that is going on your site. If you still haven’t gotten around to starting a blog, then make now the year to change that. The internet has made it easier to compare different businesses, so you need to find a way that shows the customer you are the company they should do business with. A blog can show customers that you are truly an expert in your field. Video content Written content isn’t going to appeal to everyone. Therefore, you need to find other means of reaching out to as many people as possible. The solution is video. Video content is being hailed as the future of content marketing, and that is probably due to the influx of mobile usage. 75 million people watch online videos every day, through social media and YouTube, and so with these kinds of figures, there is no reason you shouldn’t be jumping on board with video content marketing. Video content offers lots of possibilities in terms of what you can do. Working with a film company can help you to produce a TV advert, a marketing campaign or brand film depending on the budget you have. You can sit down and discuss strategically what video content you would like to produce. Your audience will be a huge factor in what you focus on. For example, if most of your audience spends their free time watching TV, rather than through streaming devices, then the more traditional route of a television advert is more suitable.

       "               'text': 'How Blogging Boosts Your Business  \\n Marketing has always been about content, and now most business websites focus on creating more of it. You’ve probably heard of push and pull marketing, the latter is what this article covers. Push marketing is offline and is focused on sales advertising e.g. displays in stores or on billboards, adverts in print whereas pull marketing entices visitors to come to you i.e. your website, from many different channels including social media, and email marketing. Pull marketing needs a lot of content and it’s given rise to the blog. Starting a blog is now easier than ever before, and you would be surprised at how much of a difference it could make to your company. There are external providers who will set up and manage your blog. There are content writers also at the ready to craft unique articles and blog posts that meet the requirements for Search and SEO.

Blogging is not just for promoting your products but you can definitely include them too. Make sure the content is informational and relevant to your site’s niche. If you use the right titles and descriptions for each blog post, then you will soon see how this approach can improve your Google ranking via search results based on keywords.

Content Types Provide a variety of content topics and use videos, images, too.  There is also interactive content that improves engagement, including surveys, games and quizzes. When there’s no way to escape writing the content use what’s close to you i.e. introduce your products, as well as the people in your business or even the policies your business adheres to as a guiding force on best practices. There really is no right or wrong way to blog.  Remember the internet is all about content and we all want tips and information instantaneously hence the billions of online keyword searches every day and the content can come from other sources too like your customers’ enquires. FAQs  Did you know the FAQ page is one of the most visited pages on a website? Consider a FAQ in the form of a blog, i.e. it’s a dynamic category within your blog that you add blog posts to regularly. Make sure you have a share plugin in your blog so your visitors and you can readily share the blog post to social media and email.

       "               'text': 'How To Make Your Own Blog Successful \\n   Many people have an idea of what they would like to do with their blogs. There are many ways to go with it; in effect, a blog is your own personal corner of the internet, and it is up to you how you use it. Everyone has one common goal, whatever the style of topic of their blog; to make it successful. For bloggers, success is subjective. Blogging may mean popularity and the potential to make money. Views are what matter most. So the main question is: how to make your own blog? Follow our six tips and you’ll have a good foundation for a successful blogging website. Table of Contents Find your niche This is a rule that isn’t specifically followed for blog users, but for people looking to be creative in general. Finding a niche is all about finding balance; while you want to stand out and be seen by others, which means doing something different and as unique as possible, it still has to be relevant and interesting. If you go too far one way, you’ll get lost in the crowd, but too far the other and there won’t be enough people who want to know what you’ve written to click on your posts and boost the view count. Build your blog on a reputable host provider You’ll need to host your blog on a provider that works for you. There are plenty out there and it’s about finding the right one. Some are more suited to certain styles, more creative, fun blogs for example. Whatever you choose, make sure you go with what is right for the demographic you’re aiming for. Find a host that provides you a server that is close to your target group. That is one of the most important factors while creating an online business. For example, don’t choose a hosting provider that has his server in South Africa while you are targeting users from the US. If you do – then your website loading time will be very slow. The result is that users won’t stay at your website. Do it yourself, don’t hire someone to do it for you Designing a blog is personal, and tailoring a blog is personal too. You shouldn’t hire someone to do this for you because even if they follow your instructions, it’ll never feel quite as pure as when you do it yourself. After all, this article is called how YOU can make your blog a success. The first step is to set it up and design it yourself. Write honest content Whatever your writing principles, stick to them. Be honest, don’t go changing your style or your focus in order to gain more views because in the long run, it’ll not work out. If you stick to what you want to write, at the end of the day you’ll be much happier, and your readership will be much more organic. It may take time to make it work but be patient and don’t move away from why you started your blog in the first place. Go mobile This is another point that is really aimed at a wider audience than just blog users. It is important to move with the times, and technology means that most people are reading articles on smartphones these days. It is important to make your blog mobile-friendly so that people can access it properly out and about. Have fun! Finally, these are among the most important things you must do. If you’re not enjoying the experience, you won’t showcase your best work. Keep the core values of your blog close and make them the reason why you do it. Focus on your authentic content and let the visitors and success find you. From there, everything else will fall into place and who knows? Maybe soon you’ll be working from a beach bar somewhere in Thailand. Check out our article about how to become a digital nomad.',\n",

       "               'text': 'How Your Credit Score May Impact Your Career \\n  In general, your personal credit score is not directly tied to your career performance or qualifications. However, did you know there are some situations where your credit history may indirectly impact your professional life? With nearly 30% of Americans suffering from terrible credit, it’s hard for many people to get out of the credit hole they’ve gotten into. Once you have bad credit, the other financial elements of your life become a struggle, and before you know it, your credit score is preventing you from getting a loan to buy essentials like a car or house! Are you applying for jobs and missing out? Employers do not have to tell you why you missed out on a role, including if it is the reason for your credit score rating. This article examines why everyone should aim for a near-perfect credit score before they need it. Table of Contents Credit Score and Your Career We mentioned earlier that employers can choose what they disclose regarding a role or job application rejection, so you may end up applying for many roles without realizing the elephant in the room is your credit score. Limited disclosure Employers can use limited disclosure to avoid sharing the reasons for rejecting you for a role. Employers can use broad-stroke reasons like ‘you didn’t meet the qualifications’ instead of telling you why you missed out. This answer is unhelpful, as as an applicant, you are likely to make the same error repeatedly and continue to miss out on suitable roles. Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) However, when employers want to do a credit check, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) requires them to seek your permission and get it in writing. Additionally, you may not have known that you can review the report they get. Insist on seeing the credit report and getting professional advice on improving it. Credit report If your credit report is not between 740 and 850, chances are you can improve it. State Laws Some states have laws that restrict credit score use in employment decisions. Currently, there are eleven states. Is your state included? California, Hawaii, Washington, Connecticut, Nevada, Colorado, Delaware, Maryland, Oregon, Vermont, and Illinois. Why Employers Need Credit Reports We’ve mentioned job applications where employment background checks can include reviewing your credit history. Industries with financial responsibility, such as accounting, finance, and roles involving handling company finances, commonly seek a credit report as part of applicant background checks. Financial Roles Most roles involve financial management or fiduciary responsibility and will likely require an excellent personal credit score. Examples of roles in financial services may include bank tellers, loan officers, investment advisors, and anyone handling clients’ money. Individuals applying for fiduciary roles, such as lawyers, trustees, and corporate board members, may also be required to authorize a credit check. Security Additionally, security is another sector, and any role that requires security clearance might require a detailed look at your financial history and credit score. People with high levels of debt are seen as risky as they might be susceptible to bribery or fraud due to economic pressures. Five Actions That Can Harm A Credit Rating 1. Closing an account at the wrong time While this action seems a bit ridiculous, you must decide when to close an account used for a loan. Closing your account too soon after you’ve paid off the balance can harm your loan accounts, such as credit cards. You may have paid off the loan on one account by transferring the balance to another and then promptly closed the nil balance account. While this is a logical step to take, the timing of the account closure can harm your credit rating. 2. Transferring your balances over to one card We’ve all heard of debt consolidation, and it’s not only a convenient solution. You also benefit from a better interest rate, so you’re paying less on the loan amount over time. Many lenders, including the big banks, advertise this strategy to reduce debt; however, if you still need to borrow funds now that all your debt is loaded onto one card, you can appear as a high-risk borrower, which impacts your credit rating. For your credit rating, did you know you’re better off spreading your borrowing over a few credit cards, so each card has a maximum of 30% owed than it is to have one card up with a high credit limit and you’re using most of it? Therefore, debt consolidation may not be excellent if you rely on your current credit score. 3. Keeping charge-offs on your credit report A charge-off is a debt the creditor deems unlikely to pay off because you have failed to meet your monthly payments for a significant period. The account is listed on your credit report as not collectible, where it will remain for seven years, potentially impacting your credit. However, you can sometimes remove your charge-offs before the seven years are up. 4. Falling behind on medical bills You might not realize that if you’ve had a medical bill sitting waiting to be paid for some time, it will ultimately be sent to a debt collection agency to deal with. That can harm your credit, so try to make medical bills your priority if you have a habit of falling behind on payments. 5. Never use your credit card Never needing a credit card should be a sign all is going really well with you financially. However, you must use credit and have a reasonable payment history to get a high credit score. Use your credit card and pay the balance every month. You now have a payment history and zero debt. Final Thoughts Understanding why your credit score is important is connected to what kind of financial future you want to have, which starts with your career. For example, earning a good income, starting or investing in a business, and meeting personal needs like renting or owning a home all require a good credit score. Conversely, ignoring or being oblivious to the importance of your credit score could result in you not reaching your full potential. If you are worried that your credit score might hurt your career prospects, you can take specific measures to improve it. These include improving your credit utilization ratio, making timely payments on bills, paying off any outstanding debts, and rectifying any errors on your credit report. Moreover, it is recommended that you stay updated about the laws and regulations in your region regarding using credit information in employment decisions. This will help you better understand your rights and make informed decisions.',\n",

       "               'text': 'The Role of Business Lines of Credit for New Businesses  \\n Navigating the financial waters of establishing a new business can be both exhilarating and daunting. For budding entrepreneurs and startup visionaries, securing a robust financial footing is paramount to turning innovative ideas into tangible success. In this complex landscape, a business line of credit emerges as a beacon of flexibility and support, offering a lifeline to new businesses that are eager to grow but may encounter unpredictable financial needs. A business line of credit (LOC) is akin to having a reservoir of funds that businesses can tap into as needed rather than receiving a lump sum upfront. A business LOC is a financial tool that’s particularly appealing for new businesses that face the dual challenge of managing day-to-day operations while also needing the agility to respond to growth opportunities or unforeseen expenses. They can draw funds up to a specified limit, pay interest only on the amount used, and replenish the available credit upon repayment. Funding is everything to a startup, so introducing a business line of credit for a new business opens a world of possibilities. It’s not merely a safety net for covering short-term cash flow gaps; it’s a strategic asset that can be leveraged to fuel investment in inventory, equipment, marketing initiatives, or even to smooth out seasonal fluctuations in revenue. This level of financial dexterity is crucial for new businesses still finding their footing in competitive markets. It may not have the extensive economic history required for more traditional loan products. In this broader context, the significance of a business line of credit extends beyond mere financial utility. It represents a vote of confidence in the potential of new businesses, providing them with the means to forge their path with greater assurance and strategic depth. As we delve deeper into the intricacies and advantages of this financial tool, it becomes clear that for new businesses poised on the brink of growth, a line of credit could well be the catalyst that transforms ambition into achievement. Table of Contents Understanding a Business Line of Credit A business line of credit (LOC) is a revolving loan that allows companies to access a predetermined amount of funds, which can be used for various operational needs. Unlike traditional loans, where the borrower receives a lump sum upfront, a LOC allows the flexibility to draw funds up to the credit limit as needed. Interest is only charged on the amount borrowed, not the total credit available, making it a cost-effective solution for managing short-term financial needs. The Lifeline for New Businesses Cash Flow Management For new businesses, which often experience fluctuating revenues and irregular cash flow, a LOC is a buffer to smooth out the financial ebbs and flows. It ensures that companies can cover expenses such as payroll, inventory purchases, and unexpected costs without depleting their cash reserves. Flexibility and Accessibility The flexible nature of a LOC is particularly advantageous for new businesses that may not have predictable financial requirements. It provides the freedom to draw funds as needed, repay, and then reuse the credit, offering a continuous source of capital. Building Credit History Establishing a positive credit history is crucial for any business, and using an LOC responsibly can help new businesses build their credit profiles. This can be beneficial for securing larger loans or better terms in the future. Qualifying for a Business Line of Credit Securing a LOC can be challenging for new businesses due to their limited operating history and lack of financial records. Lenders typically assess a business’s creditworthiness based on credit score, financial statements, cash flow projections, and business plans. New companies can enhance their eligibility by: Maintaining a Strong Personal Credit Score: Lenders may consider the personal credit of the business owners, especially in the absence of extensive business credit history Providing Collateral: Offering assets as collateral can increase the chances of approval and potentially secure more favourable terms. Demonstrating Strong Business Potential: A well-crafted business plan that highlights market potential, revenue projections, and strategic plans for growth can reassure lenders of the business’s viability Strategic Management of a Business Line of Credit Effectively managing an LOC is crucial to maximize its benefits while minimizing costs and risks. Use your LOC wisely by reserving the LOC for short-term needs or emergencies rather than long-term investments. This ensures the credit remains available when most needed. Also, monitor balances and repayments by regularly reviewing the credit balance and making timely repayments to avoid high interest costs and potential damage to credit scores. Additionally, understand the terms by being fully aware of the interest rates, fees, repayment terms, and any conditions that may trigger changes in terms or rates. Final Thoughts It’s not just about having funds available; it’s about creating a strategic financial buffer that empowers businesses to seize opportunities without the constant worry of cash flow disruptions. As these new ventures evolve, the judicious use of a line of credit can play a pivotal role in smoothing out the peaks and valleys of their financial landscape. Moreover, in the fast-paced world of startups and new enterprises, the ability to quickly respond to market demands, invest in emerging technologies, or capitalize on unforeseen opportunities can be the difference between thriving and merely surviving. When managed with foresight and discipline, a business line of credit becomes more than a financial tool—it transforms into a strategic asset, fostering growth and innovation. However, the journey doesn’t end with securing and utilizing a line of credit. It’s equally important for businesses to continuously review their financial strategies, adapt to changing market conditions, and maintain open lines of communication with their lenders. This proactive approach ensures the effective use of the credit line and positions the business as a reliable borrower, potentially leading to more favourable financial arrangements in the future. In conclusion, as new businesses embark on their journey, a business line of credit can serve as a critical component of their financial toolkit, providing the liquidity needed to navigate the uncertainties of the business world. By embracing this financial resource with strategic intent and responsible management, businesses can lay a strong foundation for sustainable growth and long-term success. In the grand scheme of entrepreneurship, a well-managed line of credit is not just a lifeline for today; it’s a stepping stone towards the financial autonomy and resilience that defines tomorrow’s industry leaders.',\n",

One of the things that scare business owners the most, especially those with startups and small businesses, is the thought of a financial crisis. There are various reasons why a financial crisis can hit a business, an industry, or a country, and no matter how much you prepare, it eventually affects people. For example, consider how a virus outbreak in one country can strangle the GDP of many other countries worldwide. Planning to succeed in every aspect of your enterprise, including staff, sales, marketing, and how you bankroll development, is prudent to survive in business. How to fund a business to manage your budget and everything related is covered in the five ways mentioned below. These approaches can help ensure minimum impact on your business in a financial crisis. Table of Contents 1. Maximize Your Liquid Savings Your assets, easily converted into cash, are called your liquid savings. Since they are readily converted into cash, they are like cash itself. The impact on their value is minimal when they are sold. Several factors need to be present for assets to be called liquid savings. These include the fact that when the market is established, there are a lot of buyers interested in purchasing, and the ownership of your assets can be transferred easily and quickly. Liquid items can include but are not limited to checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposit, and short-term government investments. Cash – Physical currency, such as banknotes and coins, or funds held in a checking account Savings Accounts – Bank savings accounts are considered liquid as they allow easy withdrawals. Money Market Accounts – These accounts often offer higher interest rates than regular savings accounts and maintain liquidity Certificates of Deposit (CDs) – While not as liquid as savings or checking accounts, CDs can still be converted into cash before their maturity date, though penalties may apply Treasury Bills (T-bills) Short-term government securities that are highly liquid and considered low-risk Short-term Investments – Some low-risk, quickly tradable investments like short-term bonds or certain mutual funds can be considered liquid savings Liquid assets are the resources you look at in a crisis, as they can be turned into instant cash at any time. Usually, there are no penalties for taking them out before maturity. Having liquid savings is crucial for financial stability, providing a safety net for unexpected expenses or emergencies. It ensures that individuals or businesses can access funds quickly and without incurring significant losses due to market fluctuations or penalties for early withdrawals. 2. Make a Budget Understanding your financial inflows and outflows is essential for businesses and individuals. It allows you to track your savings, establish an emergency fund, and assess whether you live within your means. Without this knowledge, it becomes challenging to make informed financial decisions. How To Create A Business Budget There is more to creating a business budget than knowing your revenue and expenses. In saying this, if all you know is your sales and costs, it’s a starting point for a budget. This information can let you know if you’re breaking even or growing, but you’ll need more data to set your business to consistently perform in the years ahead. 1. Goals, Targets Experts say it’s best to start your budget with your business goals – creating short- and long-term goals and setting financial targets to achieve them once you have them. To help with the financial targets, you need to know what’s happened to date, and that requires a dig into any historical data, e.g., financial statements, balance sheets, and so on. 2. Expenses, Revenue Do you know your fixed from your variable costs? Fixed costs include rent, salaries, and insurance; variable costs include marketing, office supplies, and utilities. Any expense can be cut or reduced without the business suffering too much. Once you have listed your expenses, including any one-off costs, e.g., technology, equipment, relocation, etc., estimate your revenue from all sources. Use your historical data and knowledge of future sales contracts to generate a revenue forecast. 3. Contingency It is advisable to have a contingency fund to prepare for any unexpected expenses and potential loss of revenue. Allocating a portion of your overall budget, typically between 5% to 10%, as a contingency fund allows for a margin of error in expense calculations. If you feel this percentage is insufficient, you can increase it accordingly. 4. Allocate, Monitor, Review and Revise You’ve now allocated the financial resources to not exceed your projected income. Track your cash flow to ensure that you have enough liquidity to cover your operational needs. Regularly review your budget against your actual financial performance. Adjust your budget as needed based on changes in the business environment. 3. Minimize Your Monthly Bills Ensuring your spending is as little as possible is an excellent practice. That doesn’t mean to start living a minimalist lifestyle immediately. Still, identifying the expenses you can live without is always a good idea, even if you don’t have to cut back on them immediately. But you must be prepared to do it if financial adversity comes your way. You are at an advantage if you are prepared to cut back on your expenses immediately. So keep an eye on your recurring monthly bills. Maintaining a budget will make looking at your monthly spending more accessible and help you determine where you are wasting your money. It could include paying for a landline that you never used to pay the extra fee for a checking account. Regarding the checking account, you can easily opt for a bank that offers free checking accounts. It can also include little things like leaving the heater or the air conditioner on when you leave the office or paying high insurance rates. Whatever the case, it is better to start cutting down immediately. If you don’t, then at least be aware of your expenses. 4. Closely Manage Your Bills Avoiding penalties and late fees is crucial for financial stability. You can ensure you don’t have to pay any extra charges by taking a few simple steps. Start by reviewing all your accounts and bills each month, either manually or with the help of a financial app. Set reminders for payment due dates and consider scheduling automatic payments for recurring bills. Creating a list of all your accounts can also assist with budgeting and keeping track of your expenses. With some planning, you can stay on top of your finances and avoid unnecessary financial burdens. 5. Get Out of Credit Card Debt If you have credit card debt, you can get buried underneath the interest charges you must pay monthly. Pay your credit card debt to reduce your worries and put yourself in a position to build a plan for the future. Once your debt is gone, you can start investing in more important things. Alternatively, you may be using a credit card to fund your business – if so, consider a virtual credit card for managing spending and tracking transactions per user. Conclusion In business, you need to expect the unexpected and plan for every eventuality. We live in a global economy, so the industry is wildly unpredictable. Your business can weather any storm when you have a well-thought-out plan. As the saying goes, ‘People don’t plan to fail; they fail to plan.’ When times get tough, you can avoid falling into business failure by taking the time and resources to adequately prepare for the challenges that lie ahead so your business can thrive no matter what. The best opportunities are often found during adversity, and the prepared businesses come out on top.',\n",

       "               'text': 'Mitigating Financial Risks: How CPAs Protect Small Businesses   \\n Certified public accountants (CPAs) can mitigate a business’s financial risk; to do so, they are more qualified than accountants. For example, in addition to a bachelor’s degree (the bare minimum requirement), CPAs have passed a regulatory exam like the U.S. Uniform CPA Exam and have work experience. CPAs are qualified to provide financial advice to business managers. To engage a CPA, their qualifications come at a premium, whether recruiting one or enlisting a third-party service. A CPA’s extensive education and expertise command a big salary, between five and six figures, depending on experience and seniority. The cost of their services, however, varies by location. Large companies need a CPA’s proficiency, and Small businesses need them just as much for reasons ranging from tax preparation to forecasting growth. Table of Contents Migrating Business’ Financial Risk How does CPA mitigate a business’s financial risk? Internal control Internal control is a less-explored aspect of business growth, but a lack thereof can be deadly. A study published in the Review of Accounting Studies states that accounting fraud cases occur in two out of five companies. As a result, publicly traded businesses lose 1.6% of their collective equity annually; in 2021, the loss was valued at USD$830 billion. Among the most common incidents involve misappropriating business funds, sometimes called embezzlement. Without the proper means to track cash flow, dishonest employees can get away with close to millions by using a legitimate expense as a front. By the time the owner discovers the deception, the company will have lost so much to the point of closure. While a CPA is not required to audit a business, they can assume some essential responsibilities to improve internal control. Examples include: Reviewing receipts and other documents reporting expenses Confirming assets and evaluating inventory procedures Educating employees and clients on the importance of proper accounting Conducting limited background checks on applicants and new hires In a way, a CPA for small businesses is at the forefront of the campaign against corruption and fraud in a business or organization. The International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) stresses that accountants are in a prime position to mitigate the effects of such acts in the public and private sectors, regardless of size, through their work. Tax compliance In September, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced it would adopt AI to go after high-income enterprises that owe millions in back taxes. Among those on the list are dozens of significant partnerships with over USD 10 billion in assets. This reinvigoration of a federal agency that has been underfunded for years should be a wake-up call for business owners to fulfill their tax obligations. Small players with limited revenue and capital can’t afford to earn the agency’s ire, as the penalties can quickly stack up against them. For instance, failure to file taxes on time slaps a 5% penalty for each month of delay and can go up to 25%. There are multiple reasons for such delays, one of which is the struggle to grasp the convoluted federal tax code. It also doesn’t help that the business is responsible for filing other than income tax, such as estimated, employment, and excise taxes. Tax planning and preparation are within the CPA’s list of expertise. Although not as specialized in the procedure as licensed tax preparers, they have extensive knowledge of business tax policies, including potential tax breaks. A company that hires one usually doesn’t need a tax preparer, especially if it needs know-how beyond taxes, such as preparing financial statements. Unlike tax preparers, CPAs are one of a few professionals who can be endowed with the Power of Attorney. With this authorization, they can represent the business on its behalf before the IRS, receiving its tax information and disputing applications of tax policies. A Power of Attorney will last until the business revokes it or appoints a different eligible individual. Financial audit Occasionally, the IRS conducts randomized, independent audits of taxpayers’ returns. While an audit by no means implicates one of an accidental error or possible fraud, it can make business owners understandably nervous. It’s estimated that these audits occur in 1% of tax returns each year, but businesses can increase their chances of being dragged in one in various ways, not the least of which include the following conditions. Revenue increase warranting movement to a different tax bracket Filing income tax when there’s no taxable income to report Filing income tax with transactions from investors and partners Failure to report all taxable income, especially if the IRS can trace it Deductions like home office expenses or using a personal vehicle for business If yours happens to be picked for an audit, the agency will inform you through telephone or mail (never via email). The letter comes with other documents, primarily Form 4549, which outlines the agency’s proposed changes to your returns moving forward. Upon receiving it, you have 30 days to review and dispute the proposal if necessary. However, appealing to the IRS is somewhat akin to taking a matter to court, as it requires valid evidence to support your argument. One such document is a certified financial statement (CFS), which can only be certified by an independent CPA. Balance sheets, cash flow statements, and income statements are common examples. As mentioned previously, a CPA can represent your business before the IRS. That’s why it’s never a bad idea to have one working for you. Business consultation While a welcome advantage, a business degree isn’t required to start a business. If household names like Facebook and Microsoft are any indication, a person doesn’t even need a college degree to do so. Regardless of formal education, any startup owner has to fight an uphill battle to achieve long-term success. Product design and marketing are only the tip of the entrepreneurial iceberg. The less thrilling yet more essential aspects, ranging from managing taxes to paying employees and suppliers, lie underneath. However, no other facet of business management is more crucial than that first step—making the call to start one. You don’t want an idea to sound good only on paper. Some experts recommend discussing it with a CPA to determine its profitability by evaluating the associated costs. In a way, your first meeting with a CPA sets your venture up for later steps in getting the startup off the ground. You’ll know a professional who can help you sort bookkeeping functions and tax obligations, among other things. Conclusion A CPA’s broad range of capabilities makes them a fundamental part of the equation for business success. If you ever plan to hire one, remember to make the most of their multifaceted talents by assigning them vital roles in the organization.',\n",

Running a business can be stressful enough, and the last thing you want is to be audited by the IRS. Even when a company has nothing to hide, it can be intimidating to handle an IRS audit. More often than not, getting audited is more severe than the event itself. Most audits are done through the mail and may work out in your favor as long as you are honest. Remember that it is essential to seek professional help if you are struggling with your taxes. The factors mentioned in this article do not guarantee an audit, and many audits are conducted randomly. That being said, below are five things that may put you on the IRS’s radar. Table of Contents Making More Money According to IRS statistics from 2016, if you show a significant increase in income from one year to the next, your chances of getting audited can increase from 0.65% to anywhere from 1.7% to 5.9%, depending on your reported income. In addition to the increase in potential auditing by moving into a new tax bracket, sudden increases in income – especially for self-employed individuals – will be red-flagged by the IRS, even when they are legitimate. Filing Income Tax When It’s Unnecessary If you file an income tax when you had no taxable income for the year, especially if you previously had, you are at higher risk of getting audited. While you must file a return regardless of how much income you made, the absence of income will raise eyebrows in the IRS. Not Reporting All Taxable Income All taxable income is required to be reported to the IRS, especially if it is traceable. The IRS receives copies of all tax forms that you receive. The IRS tracks anything paid to you by other entities, such as salary payments (W-2s or 1099s), dividend income, and interest paid. Tax professionals can review your files before submitting them to ensure you are not missing any pertinent information. Improper Use of Reported Income If you report income used for purposes other than stated, you increase your chances of getting contacted by the IRS. This typically happens when people invest money into an idea. Tax Evasion You are at perhaps the highest risk of getting audited by not paying or purposely underpaying taxes. There are many clues the IRS will look for to find individuals who are participating in tax evasion. Some red flags include claiming 100% use of assets (such as a vehicle) for business, deducting business travel and meals, taking higher-than-average deductions compared to other companies in your field, or anything else that could be seen stretching the truth. This is especially true with self-employed individuals. For some individuals, nothing is more terrifying than getting contacted by the IRS. In reality, these routine audits should be nothing more than a formality you must engage in as a professional. Audits are nothing to be concerned about for an honest taxpayer. More Factors Are you keen to know more factors that may increase your IRS audit risk? Foreign Bank Accounts and Income The IRS is vigilant about offshore income and assets. Failing to report foreign bank accounts or income can lead to severe consequences. Rental Property Individuals with rental properties may be subject to audits, especially if there are discrepancies in reported rental income and expenses. Frequent Use of Cash Transactions A high volume of cash transactions without proper documentation may attract attention from the IRS. Last Few Words Please remember that attempting to evade or avoid an IRS audit through illegal or unethical means is not advisable and can lead to severe consequences. The IRS has various methods to identify and address non-compliance. To state the obvious, it’s essential to be honest and accurate when filing your taxes. If you’re unsure about certain deductions or have complex financial situations, consider seeking advice from a tax professional to ensure compliance with tax laws. Keep thorough records and retain documentation to support your claims in case of an audit.',\n",

Popular subscription-based accounting software includes platforms like QuickBooks and ZipBooks. These platforms provide a range of features, including invoicing, expense tracking, financial reporting, and integration with other business tools. However they are not the same and there are differences worth knowing including range in price, features, and even level of customer support. Which is the best for your bookkeeping needs? Let’s find out. Table of Contents ZipBooks Designed to be the perfect fit for small entrepreneurs. In other words, startups and micro-businesses that have minimal transactions to record every month can benefit significantly from ZipBooks. It is an excellent ‘starter’ accounting program for entrepreneurs or freelancers and clearly better than using computer spreadsheets or handwritten ledgers. Dashboard The ZipBooks Dashboard includes Quick Stats, Accounts Receivable, Key to Bar Graph, and your Business Health Score. Quick Stats is a section that offers an instant snapshot of revenues collected over the past year as well as the previous month’s net income. A current-to-date accounts receivable balance is displayed, and there is the option to click for more details under the categories of View Report, where you can dig deeper into the Aging A/R stats. A bar graph appears, and the key is explained here. Blue shows revenue, gold is expenses, and green indicates profit. The green bar shows in red when expenses are more significant than revenue. Business Health Score will show a figure out of 100. If the number is low, you can click on it, and the ZipBooks program will provide suggestions on improving your bookkeeping setup. Customer Service While both ZipBooks and QuickBooks provide customer service when compared head-to-head, QuickBooks offers much more than ZipBooks. Here is a look at what each provides: Zipbooks provides multiple options for customer services, including chat and helpdesk. All you have to do to reach a ZipBooks support agent is log into your account and click the “Start A Conversation” (lower right corner of the screen). You can search for assistance by typing a keyword or two into the search window. The Accounting Basics section has several FAQs and step-by-step instructions on how to start using this program. Pricing There are a total of four different pricing plans. They range from $0 to $125 per month. Here is a look at each: ZipBooks Starter is free and provides access for one user. It allows you to produce an unlimited number of invoices and unlimited customer/vendor contact tracking. It connects to a single bank/credit card account. Another ZipBooks Smarter starts at $15 per month, but it gives you the ability to have an unlimited number of users. You can automatically send unlimited recurring invoices and track hours worked by contractors/employees. This program will quickly transfer those hours to customer invoices. ZipBooks Sophisticated starts at $35 per month and includes everything in the ZipBooks Smarter program with some extras. They include tracking of income/expenses by location/project. You will also be able to create bank reconciliations, and there are advanced reporting features. The last, ZipBooks Services, is the top level, costing $125 monthly. It provides a dedicated bookkeeper who will categorize all transactions and reconcile bank and credit card accounts, plus one more feature. You will have someone who will prepare monthly financial statements for you. QuickBooks for Mac On the other hand, QuickBooks is designed to fit well with any size business and is the best-known of the pair. It has many more features and has a vast network of advisors. Plus, QuickBooks is used by more businesses than any other software program. It has three different business tiers designed to fit various-sized enterprises. While it is a good fit for entrepreneurs, medium-sized companies, and giant corporations, this program is more expensive. However, it has several more features than ZipBooks. Dashboard The QuickBooks Dashboard contains a Left Menu Bar, Sales, Profit and Loss, Expenses, and Invoice tabs. The left menu is a multi-functional menu bar as it gives you access to most program features in the same way keyboard shortcuts would. The sales section gives you a visual of sales figures with an ongoing updated current figure for reference. Then, you can monitor the profit and loss situation of your business without having to run a report for the same data. QuickBooks offer omnichannel customer support, including chat, phone, email, knowledgebase, guideline, and various tutorials. You can reach a QuickBooks support agent by logging into your account and clicking the ‘Help’ option. You can phone to speak to a support agent six days a week (6 AM – 6 PM PST on weekdays, 6 AM – 3 PM PST on Saturdays). A free course with video tutorials and written instructions to aid you in setting up your bookkeeping program. There are a total of three different pricing plans. Here is a look at each of them: Pricing Simple Start is $15 per month and allows access for just one user. It will create invoices and track accounts receivable. The second plan is Essentials, which costs $35 per month and includes all of the features in Simple Smart plus some extras. They have unpaid bill tracking, check printing, and access for up to three users and two accountants. And the third plan starts at $50 per month and comes with all the Essentials features. Added to this is access for up to five users and two accountants. Additional extras are tracking reports for 1099 contractors, budgeting/forecasting tools, and project tracking. Ease of Use Both ZipBooks and QuickBooks for Mac are designed to be user-friendly. Plus, you do not require a bookkeeping background to use or understand how these programs work. Both utilize simple language rather than industry terminology, aiding the user experience. The main difference at startup is the dashboard’s appearance on each program. Here is a look at each of them: In Conclusion The decision on which of the accounting software programs, ZipBooks or QuickBooks, is best for your business depends on the size of your business. Both can accommodate any size company, although ZipBooks is probably best suited for smaller entrepreneurs. If you demand more features, then QuickBooks would be your obvious choice.',\n",

       "               'text': 'How To Keep Track Of Your Business Finances \\n  One of the essential elements of running a successful company is tracking business finances, which involves keeping tabs on business income and expenses. A lack of funds is one of the primary reasons why businesses fail. Cash flow is crucial, so companies must manage expenses by recording receipts, payments, or expenses into an accounting ledger. There are also several benefits of tracking your business finances, including: Managing your money more effectively Identifying spending issues Improving your budgets Promoting savings Remaining focused on your financial goals Keeping tabs on your business finances ensures your company grows well to overcome competition. So, how can you implement various strategies to monitor your business finances? By taking the following actions: Table of Contents Developing A Cash Flow Statement Creating a cash flow statement is the first and most straightforward way to keep track of your business finances. It’s one of the final accounts and provides information regarding an enterprise’s health. For instance, it offers insights into how cash and cash equivalents change over time. Simply, a cash flow statement shows how money gets in and out of the company. In addition, a cash flow statement tells you how you get and utilize money. As such, you’ll be able to track your finances. However, you must come up with a comprehensive cash flow statement. In other words, it should comprise three major sections: financing, investing, and operating activities. One of the best ways to prepare a cash flow statement is to work with experts. However, you can complete the task yourself if you don’t have enough budget to hire a professional. Consider watching online videos and reading blogs on how to make a cash flow statement. Keeping A Separate Business Bank Account Another simple but effective strategy for tracking business finances is to open a separate business bank account. Doing so helps separate your personal and business money. As a result, you’ll know how much money gets in and out of your business. Although separating business and personal bank accounts is necessary for tracking company finances, some business owners still ignore this step. You should avoid this kind of mistake since it could be stressful. For instance, you might struggle to calculate taxes, leading to underpaying or overpaying taxes. Leveraging The Power Of Accounting Software Modern technologies form an integral part of running a business. They help streamline operations to save time and other resources. So, consider integrating new technologies into your business systems. Any company area can benefit from new technologies, and tracking finances is no exception. You can do that by installing accounting software. This application helps store business accounting information in digital form. You can also use it to keep track of business finances. Utilizing accounting software to track business finances is beneficial since it minimizes errors. Tracking finances manually increases the risks of human error, so you won’t get a clear picture of your company’s position. One more advantage of utilizing accounting software is it will lower expenses. For example, you can generate payment and expense reports in no time. This eliminates hiring a whole team for financial data entry and analysis. A few staff members will be enough to complement the already installed accounting software. As a consequence, you’ll reduce labor costs. However, not every accounting software on the market can be suitable for tracking your business finances. You should exercise due diligence to find the right tool for your organization. For example, a housing association’s accounting and financial reporting needs differ from those required by a retail business. Accounting software for housing associations will need to include the following: Ability to track and manage rent payments. Track property-related expenses Integrate with bank accounts Automation of routine tasks such as invoicing and payment reminders Security measures for access Audits tracking changes and user activity Additionally, ensure that you source your accounting software from a reputable vendor. Connecting All Your Financial Institutions Managing various bank accounts from different financial institutions isn’t easy. In that case, you can connect your bank accounts by using accounting software. Connecting your bank accounts lets you manage your finances from a centralized location. Furthermore, it allows you to automatically download and post all your bank transactions to the appropriate ledgers. All this helps you track your business finances more efficiently. For instance, you can account for every payment received or expense incurred by your enterprise. Using Cash Accounting Or Accrual Accounting Basis Cash and accrual accounting are both acceded principles in recording payments and expenses. However, for consistency purposes, you should choose one. Before you track your business finances, decide whether to settle for a cash or accrual accounting basis. With the cash accounting method, you’ll record financial transactions. For instance, you register the payment as income only when received. Likewise, you document expenses once you pay them. On the other hand, an accrual accounting basis requires you to record income and expenses as soon as they occur. Therefore, you won’t have to wait until you receive money or make payments to register on your books of accounts. Using either cash or accrual accounting method gives you a complete view of your business, enabling you to easily track finances. Reviewing Expenses Regularly Regularly reviewing and categorizing business expenses is an effective way to track your finances. Going over your costs allows you to develop a deeper understanding of your business and find ways to grow it. By reviewing expenses regularly, you can control costs as well. You’ll know how much and what you’re spending your money on. You see these everyday figures as a marker to check whether you’re under or over your monthly budget. Apart from becoming financially aware of your expenses, you can determine the proper budget, eliminate bad spending habits, and adopt good ones. Takeaway Whether you and your team have a small business or a large enterprise, tracking business finances is a surefire way to reach your goals. Monitoring finances is essential since it’s one of the best ways to promote growth and ensure your company’s success. Hence, if your business isn’t keeping tabs on its expenses, you should start drafting a plan for managing all your business finances today.',\n",

       "               'text': 'The Steps To Starting An HVAC Business \\n  For several reasons, starting an HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) business can be a worthwhile venture. There is a growing demand for the units as they are more energy-efficient than other heating and cooling systems. Plus, your HVAC business can sell the units, installation, and ongoing maintenance services. Providing maintenance services can result in a steady stream of recurring revenue. Many customers opt for regular maintenance contracts to ensure their HVAC systems operate efficiently and avoid unexpected breakdowns. Even during economic downturns, people and businesses still require functioning heating and cooling systems, and as more residential and commercial buildings are constructed, they are continuously needed. However, starting an HVAC business can be a complex process, and it’s essential to understand all the steps involved, from registering your business as an LLC and applying for the necessary permits and licenses to learning about the regulations and understanding the market. If you are already an HVAC technician, then you appreciate the business of HVAC installation and repair. However, as a technician, you’re not automatically set up for success as a business owner. With this Business Blog guide, you’ll have all the information you need to confidently start your HVAC business. Table of Contents Business Basics Your first action in starting a business includes several steps that will vary depending on your location and the type of business you’re creating. Market Research Business Plan Business Structure Regulations and licenses Suppliers Inventory Systems Research All businesses must be thoroughly researched before committing funds – yours and maybe a loan. Before launching your HVAC business, do market research. Be sure you know why you want to have your own HVAC business and that it is for the right reasons. Identify your target market, competition, and potential demand for your product or service in the location or area you wish to operate. Know who your competitors are and if there is room for another operator. Your research will reveal if there are any gaps in products and services that you can fulfill and, therefore, create your own market without direct competitors. For pricing models, consider a subscription service model where your clients pay a monthly or quarterly fee for their HVAC servicing. The subscription service model is attractive to businesses as it helps them ensure they have regular cash flow. The cost of starting an HVAC business ranges from $2000 – $10,000. However, you will more than likely exceed this estimate. Remember to research startup costs so you know you can afford it and, if not, how you will fund it. Your startup costs and projections will be itemized in your business plan. Research Suppliers and Equipment One of the most critical aspects of establishing a successful HVAC business is sourcing quality supplies and equipment from reliable vendors. Start by researching which names are well-reviewed among your peers, and consider talking to veteran HVAC professionals who’ve been in the biz for years. You should also compare prices between suppliers to ensure you get the best deal on materials, tools, and other needed parts. You may get discounts or exclusive pricing if you sign up for their customer loyalty programs or negotiate bulk purchases. Business Plan Create a detailed business plan outlining your goals, target audience, marketing strategy, financial projections, and operational plan. There really is no way around this requirement. For funding, lenders will ask for your business plan, and you will need to ensure it has information on how you plan to fund your business, whether through personal savings, loans, investors, or other means. Your business plan will also detail your staffing requirements, technology needs, marketing and sales strategy, and budget. Business Structure When starting your HVAC business, you will need to decide on the legal structure of your business. Do you want it as a sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company (LLC), or corporation? The structure will impact your liability, taxation, and other legal aspects. The very first decision is to pick the proper business structure. Each entity has other pros and cons, too. For example, an LLC offers limited liability protection but also requires filing fees, while a corporation allows you to have investors but also carries additional compliance requirements and paperwork. Seek professional advice from an accountant before choosing the business structure for your HVAC business. Business Name Choosing a business name for your HVAC company is fun. Make sure it’s unique to do that. You will need to check its availability. Register your business name with the appropriate government authorities. Regulations and Requirements Every business is subject to specific regulations, including those for HVAC businesses. You might need a license, zoning approval, or other local regulations depending on where your business is located. Make sure to research the regulations for your state and county to ensure compliance before you start. Understanding any requirements imposed by insurance companies or other entities is also essential. The initial research you do will help keep you from running into surprise costs down the line. As you must comply with local, state, and federal regulations related to your industry, add what your business needs to your business plan, including costs for compliance. Tax ID, Business Bank Account, Financial Systems Obtain a tax identification number (TIN) or employer identification number (EIN) from the tax authorities. Open a business bank account to separate your business finances from personal finances. Then, choose an accounting system to manage your finances. To manage cash flow, use an online SaaS subscription model like Xero. Once you have organized your account, it is time to set up a system for invoicing, tracking expenses, and managing cash flow. Insurance We recommend getting business insurance, including premises, contents, limited liability, and professional indemnity. Insurance is necessary for risk mitigation and asset protection. If you have staff, you will also need Workers Compensation Insurance. Hire Staff Your business will need staff, and they will most likely be employees. In your business plan, establish a hiring process and create job descriptions. Familiarize yourself with employment laws and regulations. Your newly hired technicians will need to be HVAC certified. Hire technicians who are either already approved or cut down on costs in the early stages of your HVAC startup, including an apprenticeship program. It’s important to remember your reputation as a quality service business will depend on your technicians having completed their apprenticeship or gone to trade school, technical school, or community college. Marketing and Sales Develop a marketing strategy to promote your business. This could include online marketing, traditional advertising, and other promotional activities. A relevant and detailed marketing plan will ensure your HVAC business gets prospective customers. To grow your pipeline of prospective customers, have a website, and invest in SEO to rank highly for local keyword searches. There’s no harm in having profiles on social media platforms to increase your reach and launch online ads that target a specific audience, such as homeowners in your area. Traditional marketing tactics like printing coupons and distributing business cards to local shops, restaurants, and other businesses also work. Utilizing multiple methods can help you attract more clients quickly and establish yourself as an expert in the industry. You will need to know how to sell and close to turn prospects into actual customers. Develop a sales strategy and templates for your salespeople so there is consistency and a steady, proven system for customer acquisition. Final Words Regularly review your business plan and financials for your HVAC business. Adapt your strategies based on performance and changing market conditions.',\n",

Some causes are unforeseen and uncontrolled, like an economic downturn and regulation changes. There are also plenty of causes of business distress that directly result from something the company or management did or failed to do. This article focuses on what a business can control and foresee and what is required to turn a company from dying to thriving. First, let’s consider why businesses need to be profitable. Table of Contents Why Businesses Need To Be Profitable Many startup businesses are in the red and then get to break even. However, to survive, companies need to make a profit, and there are several crucial reasons. Sustainability Profit is essential for the long-term sustainability of a business. It provides the necessary funds to cover operational expenses, invest in growth, and adapt to changing market conditions. Investment and Growth Businesses need to be competitive to attract customers and to do this, they need to become sustainable. Funds are required for reinvestment in the business, which could involve expanding operations, developing new products or services, upgrading technology, or entering new markets. Without profits, a business may struggle to fund these growth initiatives.  If the funds can not come entirely from profit, the company must attract capital from investors. Investors and lenders are more likely to support businesses that demonstrate a track record of profitability. Capital providers want to see a return on their investment through loans or equity investments, and profits signal that the business can deliver this. Attract and Retain Staff A profitable business can attract and retain talented employees by offering competitive salaries, benefits, and career development opportunities. Employees are more likely to stay with a company that can provide stability and growth. Technology like AI and automation can do many tasks in most business areas today. However, human staff are needed for strategic roles in marketing and sales, customer support, and operations management. Risk Management and Obligations Profit serves as a buffer against unforeseen challenges and risks. It provides a financial cushion to help a business weather economic downturns, industry fluctuations, or unexpected expenses. Businesses must meet various financial obligations, such as paying suppliers, servicing debts, and fulfilling employee commitments. A company may struggle to meet these obligations without profit, leading to economic instability. Common Causes Of Financial Distress Now we know why a business needs to be profitable, let’s look at common causes of financial distress. 1. Poor Financial Management and Cash Flow Inadequate financial planning and monitoring is often the start of the demise of a business. Without it your business can not prepare of events that will challenge your revenue. With enough revenue to cover expenses, your business can keep operating. However, there is always financial stress when a company is just breaking even.  Any negative event can push the business into the red and negative cash flow. To survive, all businesses need to be profitable.  We recently updated an article on the topic of cash flow for the self-employed, in which many small businesses are budding startups. Solution Implement robust financial management practices, regularly review financial statements, and seek professional advice. Improve invoicing and collections processes, negotiate better payment terms with suppliers, and maintain a cash reserve for emergencies. 2. High Levels of Debt There are two types of debt. Good debt and bad debt. Which do you have? Good debt is typically associated with investments that have the potential to increase in value over time. Examples include student loans (investing in education), mortgages (investing in real estate), and business loans (investing in a business). Loans for investments that also have low interest rates are the best. For example, mortgage rates and student loan rates are often lower than interest rates on credit cards Excessive debt and high interest payments can strain finances.  Additionally, all that debt will be weighing on your mind. Solution Restructure debt, negotiate with creditors for better terms, and focus on reducing unnecessary expenses. Many small business owners use their home loans for business purposes because it is a lower interest rate than a standard business loan. However, this action does come with the risk that if the business fails, the loan repayments still need to be made and the loan repaid within the loan term. 3. Market Competition Intense competition can erode profit margins and market share. Solution Conduct a thorough market analysis, differentiate products or services, and explore new markets or customer segments.  Consider reading the book The Immutable Laws of Marketing to hone your strategies to become a leader in a new market with few or no competitors. 4. Operational Inefficiencies Inefficient processes can lead to increased costs and reduced productivity. Solution Streamline operations, invest in technology for automation, and optimize the supply chain to enhance efficiency.  Use SaaS, which spreads the cost of software services for managing your operations from bookkeeping to marketing. 5. Lack of Strategic Planning The absence of a clear business strategy can result in poor decision-making.  Operating your business without a plan is high risk. Solution Develop a strategic plan, set measurable goals, and regularly review and adapt the plan based on market conditions. Make sure to check your progress by also setting milestones so you know your business is doing what it needs to do to become sustainable. 6. Ineffective Marketing Inadequate marketing can result in reduced customer acquisition and retention.  Being the ‘world’s best-kept secret’ is not what you want for your business. Solution Invest in targeted marketing campaigns, enhance the online presence, and focus on building strong customer relationships. Hire a marketing team who knows how to create a business presence on social media and create relevant content on your website to share with your followers and in a regular email marketing campaign.  SEO is more vital today than ever as Google updates its search algorithms often.  Is your website set up for Google Analytics 4? Final Words Turning a company around often involves a combination of these strategies tailored to the specific challenges faced by the business. Business owners can seek professional advice, engage with stakeholders, and proactively address financial distress to achieve long-term financial success. Awareness of common causes and solutions will enable your business to reverse financial distress into financial success.  ',\n",

Budgeting helps hone a business owner’s focus on performance and income versus spending. Other ways to improve your cash flow include managing your invoices and receivables keeping a close eye on expenses and financing options. This article covers ways you can manage your cash flow better when employed, which is the tax status of most new businesses before they are incorporated. Table of Contents Create A Detailed Budget If your business is financially challenging, creating a budget is the first thing you need to do. When you take the time to budget int, resting revelations occur. For example, you will probably find you’ve been spending more than you’re earning or overspending during months when less income is received. It’s better to be informed and in control rather than deal with the fallout of sudden cash flow shortfalls. When you carefully look at expenses and see what needs to be trimmed, leave everything on the table. For example, underperforming small businesses may need to save money by downsizing office space. Or letting go of your commercial office and setting up remote working for you and your team. If your type of offering needs a workplace, you can consider flexible leasing arrangements or co-working spaces where there may not be a lease. Additionally, if you’re downsizing your office space, you can sell your office equipment and use what’s available in the co-sharing environment. How to create a budget Creating a budget is crucial for managing your finances effectively, primarily when you are self-employed. Develop a comprehensive budget outlining your fixed and variable expenses, forecast income, and an emergency or contingency fund. Expenses Categorize expenses into essential and non-essential to prioritize payments during lean periods. Fixed expenses – e.g., rent/lease, utilities, insurance, loan payments, subscriptions. Variable expenses, e.g., marketing and advertising, office supplies, travel expenses, meals and entertainment, and professional fees (accountant, lawyer, etc.) Forecast Income Project your future income to anticipate potential cash flow gaps when considering your current expenses and when they are due. Consider seasonal fluctuations and irregularities in income. With this awareness, you may find time to consider a side hustle. Set Aside Emergency Funds Establish an emergency or contingency fund to cover unexpected expenses or periods of low income. Having a financial cushion can help you weather temporary setbacks. Consider a Line of Credit Explore the possibility of obtaining a business line of credit to cover short-term cash flow gaps. With a line of credit, you can draw down and repay as and when required to cover shortfalls in cash flow. Use it judiciously and pay it off promptly to avoid accruing excessive interest. Invoice Promptly and Follow Up on Payments Send out invoices promptly after completing a job or delivering a product. Follow up on overdue payments to ensure a steady cash flow. Use Technology for Invoicing and Accounting Utilize invoicing and accounting software to streamline financial processes. Automated systems can help you stay organized and track your cash flow in real time. Choose a service with an app so you can send out an invoice from your phone to speed up the task. You can also receive alerts of payments. Offer Discounts for Early Payments Encourage prompt payment by offering discounts to clients who pay invoices early. Be discerning with whom you work with. Choose clients who pay promptly and reward them accordingly. Negotiate Favorable Payment Terms Negotiate payment terms with suppliers that align with your cash flow cycle. You will want to ensure you are considered a valuable customer so your suppliers provide discounts and the best deals. Seek extended payment terms or discounts for early payments when dealing with vendors. Negotiate either longer payment terms or a cheaper rate for paying early. Diversify Income Streams Managing cash flow when you’re self-employed is an ongoing challenge. You think you’ve got it all sorted out, and then you lose a supplier or customer and, with it, the favorable terms that have helped you manage your cash flow. To ease the burden with your primary offering, explore additional sources of income to reduce dependence on a single client or revenue stream. Side hustles can turn into full-time businesses. Diversification of income streams can provide stability if one income source is temporarily disrupted. Monitor and Control Expenses Regularly review your expenses to identify areas where costs can be reduced. You may have a new budget; however, over time, more payments will be required, so you need to manage your existing outgoings for their relevancy. Cut unnecessary expenses and make a date in your calendar to regularly renegotiate contracts with suppliers if possible. Build Strong Client Relationships: Cultivate strong relationships with clients to encourage repeat business. It is easier to sell to and retain a customer than acquire a new one.  Plus, selling to an existing customer will cost less, and satisfied clients are more likely to pay promptly and recommend your services. Regularly Review and Adjust Periodically review your cash flow management strategies and adjust them based on your business’s evolving needs. Be flexible and adapt to changes in the market or your industry. By implementing these steps, self-employed individuals can enhance their ability to manage cash flow effectively, reducing financial stress and promoting the long-term success of their businesses. Keep Business and Personal Finances Separate According to Inc. Magazine, small business owners must maintain separate business and personal expenses accounts. Otherwise, you risk putting too much of your personal funds into your business. With a business bank account, you can automatically transfer data to your tax and financial statements, making the accountant’s job easier and cheaper. Pay Yourself the Market Rate Inc. also advises small business owners to not undercut their own salary. Many small business owners try to low-ball bids beyond a figure that allows them to make a living wage. Charging too little harms cash flow and makes sticking to a budget tough. Later, you will have to charge customers more for your products or services. Get Financial Advice from a Professional There is so much to do when you are in business for yourself.

       "               'text': 'Maxwell takes a break to refresh after asking to be rested by RCB play Glenn Maxwell has elected to take a break from the IPL to refresh himself physically and mentally after requesting Royal Challengers Bengaluru management pick someone else in his place for the match against Sunrisers Hyderabad. Maxwell has been struggling for runs in IPL 2024. Before Monday\\'s game, he had scored only 32 runs in six innings at an average of 5.33. There were speculations that he might have sat out because of a thumb injury but that was not the case. \"For me, personally, it was a pretty easy decision,\" Maxwell said after RCB\\'s sixth defeat in seven matches. \"I went to Faf [du Plessis] and the coaches after the last game and said I felt it was probably time we tried someone else. I have been in this situation in the past where you can keep playing and get yourself deeper into a hole. I think now is actually a good time for me to give myself a bit of a mental and physical break, get my body right. If I\\'m required to get in during the tournament, I can hopefully get back into a really solid mental and physical space where I can still have an impact. \"We have had a pretty big deficiency straight after the powerplay, which has been my area of strength over the last couple of seasons. I felt like I wasn\\'t contributing in a positive way with the bat, and with the results and the position we find ourselves on the table, I think it\\'s a good time to give someone else an opportunity to show their wares, and hopefully, someone can make that spot their own.\" Coming into IPL 2024, Maxwell was in red-hot form. In 17 T20s since the start of November, he had 552 runs at an average of 42.46 and a strike rate of 185.85. During this period, he scored two hundreds as well. But he started the IPL with a first-ball duck against Chennai Super Kings. Since then, he has had two more ducks and has lasted more than five balls only once - against Kolkata Knight Riders, when he made a 19-ball 28 with the help of two dropped catches. \"T20 cricket can be like that sometimes - it\\'s a pretty fickle game,\" he said. \"Even if you look at the first game, I ran one off the middle of the bat to the keeper. I picked up the length really well, saw a scoring opportunity, but opened the face a little bit too much. When you are going well, that goes wide of the gloves, you get a boundary, you are 4 off 1, and you are away for the tournament. \"I probably just haven\\'t got away - it\\'s as simple as that. In the first few games, I feel I made reasonably good decisions, but I was still finding ways to get out. It can happen in T20 cricket and when it snowballs like that, you can go searching and try too hard and forget the basics of the game.\" The SRH game, though, turned out to be a high-scoring one. Batting first, SRH posted 287 for 3, the second-highest total in T20 cricket. RCB replied with 262 for 7, making it 549 for the match, the most for a T20. play 2:12 Inside Glenn Maxwell\\'s battle to find form at the IPLThe Australia allrounder talks about how he goes about training, going from a \\'shocker\\' of net one day to one of his best the next Maxwell was asked if, in hindsight, he wished he had played one more game. \"I did notice during the powerplay that the pitch was not as slow and two-paced as it has been in the first few games,\" he said with a smile. \"And I realised it was probably a bad game to miss; it would have been nice to be out there batting. \"But as I said, I wanted to give myself not just the physical break but also the mental break to give myself the right to play professional cricket. I take a lot of pride in my performance, and I put in a lot of hard work behind the scenes to get my body right for every game. And it has been a pretty tough struggle, given my body is on the wrong side of 30. I think that physical and mental toll probably just wore me down a little bit.\" Maxwell had a similar IPL season in 2020 as well. Playing for Kings XI Punjab then, he managed only 108 runs in 11 innings, at an average of 15.42 and a strike rate of 101.88. He did not hit a single six that year. \"That was probably a different scenario,\" Maxwell said. \"Back then the thing that was hurting me was I was bowling really well. So I was actually playing more as a spinner who was used at the back end [with the bat]. We had KL [Rahul] and Mayank [Agarwal] who were the two leading run-scorers in the competition at that time, so there wasn\\'t a lot of balls left in the game. So I wasn\\'t able to get any match rhythm. And when I was, it was only for a few balls here and there. \"So I said the same thing to the Kings XI management back at the time, that we can have an overseas bowler in my place. But we didn\\'t have an offspinner as well. So I sort of played as an overseas offspinner who could bat a little bit. \"The management here has been outstanding. We\\'ve been working together on taking a fair bit of ownership and the off-field leadership staff is trying to help out as much as they can. Unfortunately, runs just haven\\'t come the way they should have when you are in really good form. I don\\'t think I\\'ve had a better six months in cricket leading into this tournament. So it\\'s frustrating when it ends up like this. But if I can get my body and my mind right, there\\'s no reason I can\\'t finish the tournament well if I do get another opportunity.\"',\n",

       "               'text': 'Pat Cummins, Nat Sciver-Brunt named as Wisden\\'s Leading Cricketers in the World Pat Cummins is jubilant after leading Australia to victory AFP/Getty Images Pat Cummins and Nat Sciver-Brunt have been named as the Leading Cricketers in the World in the 2024 edition of Wisden Cricketers\\' Almanack, published on Tuesday. Cummins, Australia\\'s fast-bowling spearhead and captain across formats, guided his side to victory over India in both the ICC World Test Championship at The Oval in June, and the 50-over World Cup in Ahmedabad in November. He also oversaw his side\\'s successful defence of the Ashes, in last summer\\'s enthralling 2-2 drawn series in England. He is the first Australian man to be named as Wisden\\'s Leading Cricketer since Michael Clarke in 2012, and succeeds his England counterpart Ben Stokes, who had claimed the honour three times in four years, in 2020, 2021 and 2023. Lawrence Booth, Wisden\\'s editor, said: \"After captaining Australia to success in the World Test Championship, Pat Cummins retained the Ashes - thanks in no small part to his late-order runs in the First Test at Edgbaston - then led Australia to victory in the World Cup final in India. In 2023, no other seamer in world cricket took more than his 42 Test wickets.\" Sciver-Brunt, meanwhile, has been recognised as the pre-eminent women\\'s cricketer of the moment, particularly in light of her starring role in the Women\\'s Ashes, in which she produced back-to-back ODI centuries to take the multi-format series to the wire. She followed those performances with an England-record 66-ball hundred against Sri Lanka, while her global appeal was recognised by Mumbai Indians at the inaugural Women\\'s Premier League auction in February, where her £320,000 price tag made her the UK\\'s best-paid female team athlete. The thrilling nature of both the Men\\'s and Women\\'s Ashes, which were played concurrently in June and July 2023, is reflected in the Anglo-Aussie flavour to Wisden\\'s Five Cricketers of the Year - an honour a player can only win once in their career and which is judged by their performance during the English home season. Three Australians are named among the Five, including the allrounder Ashleigh Gardner, whose 12 wickets in the one-off Women\\'s Test at Trent Bridge were instrumental in her team\\'s retention of the Ashes. She is the tenth female recipient of an honour that dates back to 1889, and the first Australian woman to be named as a Cricketer of the Year since Ellyse Perry in 2020. The other Australians in the Five are Usman Khawaja, the leading run-scorer in the Men\\'s Ashes with 496 runs at 49.60 including a series-defining hundred at Edgbaston, and Mitchell Starc, the leading bowler with 23 wickets at 27.08, who also claimed 16 wickets in the World Cup triumph. Harry Brook, England\\'s break-out star of the 2022-23 winter, is also named alongside Mark Wood, whose selection for the third Test at Headingley last summer was the catalyst for England\\'s stirring fightback in the series. \"Wood turned the Ashes on its head,\" Booth said. \"He topped 96mph, took five for 34, and pushed Australia on the back foot, literally and figuratively. In all, he claimed 14 wickets at just 20 apiece as England came from 2-0 down to square the series.\" Travis Head, meanwhile, has been awarded the Wisden Trophy for the year\\'s best Test performance, following his match-seizing innings of 163 from 174 balls in the World Test Championship final. He succeeds Jonny Bairstow as the second winner of Wisden\\'s newest award, with the trophy having previously been contested during England-West Indies Test series from 1963 to 2020, until it was succeeded by the Richards-Botham Trophy. The other notable award in this year\\'s publication goes to the West Indian Hayley Matthews, who is the first female to be named the Leading Twenty20 Cricketer, after a run of eight consecutive T20I match awards, in which period she averaged 88 with the bat, at a strike-rate of 144, and 12 with the ball. The compelling nature of the Ashes battle is an enduring theme of this year\\'s Almanack, with Booth making the point in his Notes by the Editor that England\\'s ultra-attacking \"Bazball\" approach to the series has already ramped up demand for this summer\\'s Test series against West Indies. \"Amid the gloomy outlook for Test cricket, here was a glimmer of hope: proof that if you put on a show, bums will fill seats,\" he wrote. \"And the 2023 Ashes were a show all right, up there with 1981 and 2005. But for rain in Manchester, it might even have rivalled Australia\\'s Don Bradman-inspired 1936-37 victory, still the only series in Test history won by a team who had trailed 2-0. \"The scoreline was almost secondary. For the first time since English cricket vanished behind a paywall, it felt like the people\\'s sport: Bazball was on their lips and, before long, in the Collins Dictionary.\" Fittingly, the series was capped by the last hurrah of one of the most enduring Ashes competitors of modern times, Stuart Broad, who claimed his 604th and final Test wicket with the last ball of the series to bow out on a high. In his Notes, Booth salutes him as \"England\\'s maker of memories\". \"The best players don\\'t simply rack up the numbers (though his final tally made you tired just thinking of it),\" Booth wrote. \"They leave an impression. Even more than [James] Anderson, Broad was England\\'s maker of memories, the curator of the family album. A rule of thumb emerged: if Broad\\'s knees were pumping, so was England\\'s blood.\" Elsewhere in his Notes, Booth appeals for a reappraisal of the so-called Spirit of Cricket, a concept that came under intense scrutiny following Bairstow\\'s controversial stumping during the Lord\\'s Test, and criticises the game\\'s administrators for undermining the competitive nature of international cricket with an increasingly inequitable split of the ICC\\'s revenues. \"In the era of global television, the West Indians have been hardest hit among the major Test teams,\" Booth wrote. \"India\\'s slice of the pie had grown from less than 25% to 38.5%, or close to $230m a year … West Indies receive 4.58%, or $27.5m. \"Yet this is where cricket finds itself, in dreary thrall to the notion that market forces must be obeyed, while patronising the West Indian game with back-handed compliments, when what it needs is hard cash. There\\'s plenty of that in cricket\\'s central pot. Is it really beyond the wit of the administrators to distribute it according to need, not greed?\"',\n",

       "               'text': 'Gloucestershire report Â£1.19 million shortfall in latest club accounts Heavy rain forced an abrupt abandonment Getty Images Gloucestershire\\'s viability as a first-class county has been cast into renewed doubt after the club reported a loss of £1.19 million in their annual accounts, published on Monday, which is more than twice the shortfall of £570,000 that they accrued in 2022-23. In her report, Gloucestershire\\'s Treasurer Rebecca Watkin insisted that the club\\'s outlook for 2024 and 2025 was more positive, but blamed the current situation on the cost-of-living crisis that has raised the club\\'s day-to-day running costs, allied to the washed-out ODI between England and Ireland in September, which would ordinarily have been a vital source of revenue, given the club\\'s non-Test and Hundred-hosting status. \"This has been a challenging year financially for a number of reasons and there is no doubt it is disappointing to be reporting a second consecutive financial deficit,\" Watkin wrote. \"Gloucestershire has experienced a tumultuous couple of years both on and off the field but despite that, we remain committed to pushing for success on the field with inspiring, competitive cricket, and will ensure all that can be done is done to return improved financial results in the years to come.\" In December, Gloucestershire\\'s board had floated the possibility of selling up the club\\'s historic Nevil Road ground, which has been their home since WG Grace assisted with its purchase in 1889 and could now be worth between £25 and £40 million, and moving to a new out-of-town venue near the junction of the M4 and M5. That prospect could be one step closer now, following an independent audit by chartered accountants, Saffery LLP, which revealed net liabilities of £5,019,000, leaving Gloucestershire in breach of its banking covenants and casting \"significant doubt on the Club\\'s ability to continue as a going concern\". A number of contributory factors were cited in the accounts, including a £67,000 increase in energy bills across four months, and an extra £43,000 in interest-rate payments. The annual £4 million funding that the club receives from the ECB is, Watkin added in her report, effectively worth around £750,000 less in real terms compared to four years ago, while other ventures - including a Ministry of Sound dance party held at the ground in July - \"did not deliver the financial returns predicted\". In his own report, David Jones, the club chair, described the year as a \"rollercoaster\", with Gloucestershire\\'s rock-bottom finish in the 2023 County Championship compounding their off-field struggles. However, with the bidding process now underway for the Women\\'s World Cup in 2026, he insisted the club remained well placed to ensure Bristol retained its status as a host city for such marquee events. On the prospect of the ground relocation, Jones reiterated the club\\'s need to remain \"open-minded\" in spite of the weight of history at the Nevil Ground, adding that the opportunity to relocate to a new, purpose-built and larger site would allow Gloucestershire to \"flourish for future generations\". A formal update on the relocation plans are anticipated in May or June, following further discussions at the club\\'s AGM on April 29.',\n",

       "               'text': \"Injury-hit Capitals look to throw a wrench into Titans' campaign Rishabh Pant and Jake Fraser-McGurk set up the chase for Delhi Capitals Associated Press Match details Gujarat Titans (GT - 6th; P6 W3 L3) vs Delhi Capitals (DC - 9th; P6 W2 L4) Ahmedabad, 7.30pm IST (2pm GMT) Big picture - Gill's Titans vs Pant's Capitals Just two points separate Gujarat Titans and Delhi Capitals, and yet they are three places apart in the points table. Titans are sixth, and like last year, have won and lost three each out of their first six games. Shubman Gill, their highest run-getter so far, has led them from the front. Another positive for Titans is Rashid Khan returning to form. Rashid had started this IPL with four wickets at 36.25 and an economy of 9.06. But in the last two matches, he has hit back with two wickets at 23, while going at only 5.75 runs an over. What will also please Titans is that Rashid has kept Capitals' captain Rishabh Pant quiet as well. Rashid has allowed Pant only 94 runs off 87 balls across all T20s. But like Gill, Pant has also shown the way for his side even as Capitals are ninth. So far, Pant has 194 runs at a strike rate of 157, having already shown shades of his best with two half-centuries, and some typically funky swipes and swats. Capitals brought their campaign back on track by beating Lucknow Super Giants last week. Jake Fraser-McGurk starred with a fifty in that game, while Kuldeep Yadav, returning from an injury, pushed LSG back with 3 for 20. But Capitals now have injury concerns around David Warner, who was hit on his finger while batting against LSG. Warner is unlikely to start against Titans, who will be wary that things could get interesting heading into the second half of the season if Capitals beat them on Wednesday. Form guide (Last five matches; most recent first) Gujarat Titans WLLWL Delhi Capitals WLLWL Team news and Impact Player strategy Gujarat Titans David Miller, who has missed three games due to a niggle, practiced in the nets two days out from the match. If Miller is available against Capitals, Titans might drop Matthew Wade. The wicketkeeping gloves would, then, go back to Wriddhiman Saha, who sat out of Titans' previous two fixtures due to a back spasm. Saha batted for a lengthy period at practice, while also keeping wicket, thus indicating that he is all but set to start against Capitals. Against Rajasthan Royals, Titans finally picked M Shahrukh Khan after he spent the season on the bench despite being signed for INR 7.4 crore. Coming on as Impact Sub for Mohit Sharma, he smashed 14 from eight balls in what turned out to be a last-ball win for Titans. They could continue to use the same pair, with who replaces whom depending on whether Titans bat or bowl first. Probable XII: 1 Shubman Gill (capt), 2 Wriddhiman Saha (wk), 3 Sai Sudharsan, 4 Vijay Shankar, 5 David Miller, 6 Rahul Tewatia, 7 Rashid Khan, 8 Noor Ahmad, 9 Umesh Yadav, 10 Spencer Johnson, 11 Mohit Sharma, 12 Shahrukh Khan Delhi Capitals It is understood that Warner experienced some swelling and underwent scans upon landing in Ahmedabad. That compounds Capitals' injury issues, after Mitchell Marsh went back to Australia on suffering a partial hamstring tear. If Warner is absent, Capitals might start with Abishek Porel if they bat first and with Jhye Richardson if they chase. Probable XII: 1 Prithvi Shaw, 2 Abishek Porel, 3 Shai Hope, 4 Rishabh Pant (capt & wk), 5 Tristan Stubbs, 6 Axar Patel, 7 Jake Fraser-McGurk, 8 Kuldeep Yadav, 9 Mukesh Kumar, 10 Ishant Sharma, 11 Khaleel Ahmed, 12 Jhye Richardson In the spotlight The top three wicket-takers last IPL were all from Titans. One of them, Mohit Sharma, has had a good time this season too. In the absence of Mohammed Shami and some support from Hardik Pandya, Mohit is Titans' leading wicket-taker this year. His eight wickets have come at 27, although he has been taken for 9.39 runs an over. But when Mohit is bowling in Ahmedabad, the average slides down to 13.03, and the economy to 7.82. So expect Mohit to have an impact with his variations again. Jake Fraser-McGurk turned 22 a day before taking Capitals to a win on his IPL debut, when he clubbed 55 from 35 balls. But he's enjoying some stardom already. Last October, Fraser-McGurk thrashed a List A century off just 29 balls, beating AB de Villiers' record of 31 deliveries. This February, in just his second ODI for Australia, he thumped 41 from only 18 balls against West Indies. With Marsh and Warner missing, Fraser-McGurk can provide just the spark Capitals need to move up the table. Stats that matter Since 2022, only three batters have scored at least 1000 runs in the IPL while averaging 40-plus and striking at above 140. Gill, one of those batters, has been the best across all three metrics. Tristan Stubbs, another of Capitals' in-form batters, has the upper hand over Rashid. Stubbs has faced nine balls from the Titans legspinner in T20s, but has smashed 22 runs off them - including three sixes. Some of Capitals' bowlers will want to be careful in case Miller is fit to play for Titans. Miller has a strike rate of 288 against Ishant Sharma, whom he has smacked for two fours and three sixes in nine deliveries in T20s. Mukesh Kumar, on the other hand, has been pumped for 24 off eight balls. Miller also strikes at 171 and 168 against Khaleel Ahmed and Axar Patel, respectively. Pitch and conditions Ahmedabad saw scores of 168 and 162 batting first in two matches, but that went up to 199 when Titans were playing Punjab Kings. The last two games were won by the chasing team, even as the first one was lost only by six runs. So expect the side winning the toss to bowl first.\",\n",

       "               'text': 'Bayern\\'s season a failure without Champions League title - Kane play Harry Kane has said he is still motivated by proving his critics wrong but admitted Bayern Munich\\'s season will be a failure if they cannot win the Champions League. Bayern host Arsenal in Wednesday\\'s quarterfinal, second leg at the Allianz Arena with the tie evenly poised at 2-2 from last week\\'s first game. - Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.) Kane began his youth career at Arsenal but was released by the club aged nine and has previously spoken about the impact it had on his career, saying it instilled a determination to push himself that contributed to a record of 15 goals in 20 games against the north London club. The 30-year-old became the all-time record goalscorer in north London derbies before leaving Tottenham for Bayern last summer in a deal worth up to €120 million ($128m). When asked at a news conference on Tuesday if he still felt the same determination to prove Arsenal wrong, Kane said: \"I think it was one of the biggest games of the season for pretty much my whole career, we played them at least twice a year for the last 10 years and it was always a big occasion, big moment. \"Maybe it was in the back of the mind, being released from a young age, and there\\'s always a point to prove -- I\\'m the type of player who, throughout my career, has had points to prove along the way. I don\\'t think that ever leaves you. I think it\\'ll always be in my DNA until I retire. \"There\\'ll always be a reason to prove someone wrong or to prove to myself I can do something, so I don\\'t think specifically back to that and think \\'I was released when I was 9 years old, I really have to make a difference tomorrow.\\' \"Now I\\'m here at Bayern Munich it\\'s just about being a top team in the Champions League. Of course I have history with them [Arsenal], but all I can do is try and help Bayern Munich qualify for the semifinal of the Champions League.\" Bayern missed out on the Bundesliga title for the first time in 12 years as Bayer Leverkusen lifted the trophy last weekend and Kane said: \"Of course, from the club\\'s point of view it will be a failed season if we don\\'t win anything this year because we\\'re expected to win, but then all you can do it take that into next year and try to turn that around. \"So I think that\\'s a harsh reality in winning and losing, you can do a lot of good things throughout the year and still end up on the losing side so I don\\'t think it\\'s as harsh as that, there\\'s a lot of things that go into it but I think the main thing for us right now is that we still have an opportunity to turn the season into a great season if we win the Champions League.\" Bayern boss Thomas Tuchel believes his team\\'s greater pedigree in the competition gives them the edge ahead of Wednesday\\'s second leg. Arsenal are playing in the Champions League for the first time in seven years and have not reached the semifinals since 2009. Six-time winners Bayern last won the competition in 2020 but they have lost at the quarterfinal stage in each of the past three seasons. \"I think we have the slight advantage of experience in our team,\" said Tuchel, who lifted the trophy a year later with Chelsea, defeating Manchester City in the final. \"We have players who have won it, we have players who have played decisive matches in this competition. But to make in an advantage, we still have to bring out our very best. \"It can also sometimes be an advantage not to have the experience and have the role as contenders, the role as a hunter. That can be something for Arsenal. To go for it after so many years. \"Also for us it\\'s not so usual for us to be in a semifinal. If you see the last years it\\'s not so easy for us, or anyone, to overcome this stage. Now the situation is here that we have one decisive match to make the next big step in this beautiful competition. \"We are determined to bring everything to the table. If the experience within our group brings us an extra 5% we are happy to bring it to the table. \"But we have to bring it. Nobody will give us anything. It\\'s like this in this competition. It\\'s super tough.\"',\n",

(2:04) MANCHESTER, England -- Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola says he \"doesn\\'t fear\" 14-time Champions League winners Real Madrid ahead of their quarterfinal second leg. City have faced Real Madrid in each of the last three seasons, knocking them out in the semifinals a year ago but losing at the same stage in 2022. - Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.) Real Madrid have reached at least the last four in 11 of the last 13 seasons, but Guardiola insists he\\'s not concerned about their stellar record in the competition ahead of the make-or-break game at the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday. \"I don\\'t fear them,\" Guardiola told a news conference on Tuesday. \"I respect them a lot. I\\'ve faced them many times. I respect Real Madrid and if I say I\\'m scared of them, I would be false. \"There\\'s the rivalry, you want to beat them and do well. Sometimes you win and sometimes you lose. But I\\'m not scared of them and if they beat me -- as has happened many times -- we will say congratulations and wish them well.\" After last week\\'s 3-3 draw in the first leg at the Bernabéu, there have now been 23 goals in the last five meetings between the two teams. City beat Real Madrid 4-0 at the Etihad in the semifinal second leg last season, but Bernardo Silva insists this version of Carlo Ancelotti\\'s team is better. \"Two different seasons, and it never happens the same game in football again,\" said Silva. \"I feel Madrid is stronger this season than last season. That was my feeling when we played them at the Bernabeu [last week]. For sure they will want a bit of revenge [for the result in Manchester last season] so it will be a very difficult game.\" After making history last season by becoming only the second English team to win a Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup treble, City remain on course to repeat it this year. Two consecutive trebles would make Guardiola\\'s side a contender for the title of the greatest club team in history and Silva has admitted that the prospect is providing motivation for the City squad. \"It\\'s obviously an inspiration,\" he added. \"We know how well this team has done and we want to create that legacy and to do another Premier League to do six in seven years and four in a row and we want to win the Champions League to do two in a row and if we win two trebles in a row that would be legacy. \"In one week we could be out of all the competitions but we are fighting for it.\"',\n",

(2:20) A 6-0 win -- including a four-goal night by one of his star players in Cole Palmer -- should have left Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino with no issues following the game. But that was far from the case, as the Argentine coach took his team to task for an incident regarding who would take a penalty kick in the second half with Chelsea already up 4-0 on Everton on Monday night at Stamford Bridge. - Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.) Captain Conor Gallagher had to intervene to shove away Nicolas Jackson and Noni Madueke as they squabbled for the ball after the latter was brought down in the box. Gallagher secured the ball then handed it to Palmer, the team\\'s designated penalty taker. \"The players and staff know that Cole Palmer is the penalty taker,\" said a furious Pochettino after the game. \"I am so, so upset about the situation. Discipline is the most important thing in our team. \"We all agree they [Jackson and Madueke] were wrong. They are not experienced players. They are young. It was very good the reaction by Conor Gallagher [to defuse things].\" \"We can\\'t show that type of behaviour,\" he continued. \"It\\'s like we are in a school, and our job is to show them they were wrong so they can learn. There will be no punishment, but this can\\'t happen again. If Palmer is on the pitch, he is the penalty taker.\" Pochettino went on to apologize for the incident and the \"bad image\" of the club that it presented. Palmer calmly slotted home the penalty -- bringing his tally to a perfect 9-for-9 from the spot this season -- to make it 5-0 and move alongside Manchester City\\'s Erling Haaland at the top of the Premier League scoring charts with 20. The goal also brought Palmer\\'s tally in all competitions to 23 as he became the first Chelsea player to reach 20 since Eden Hazard in 2018-19. \"He was a player always with the capacity to score when at Manchester City, but I think the way he has adapted himself is fantastic,\" Pochettino said of Palmer. \"He is amazing for the team, for him, and he is showing that the club made the right decision in signing him. \"Overall, I am happy with the performance. We showed a different approach than against Sheffield United [a 2-2 draw last Sunday]. We improved in different areas, and today was the perfect game.\" - When players fight over penalties: Ronaldo, Neymar, Mbappé\\'s spot-kick spats With Chelsea, who have struggled all season in Pochettino\\'s return to England, finally rounding into form and chasing the European places in the Premier League, the former Tottenham Hotspur coach said it was time for his team to grow up and learn from its mistakes. \"It\\'s impossible after a performance like this to have this type of behavior that shows that we are in a process, and we will learn a lot,\" Pochettino added. \"We are a great team fighting for big things. We need to change and think more in a collective way. \"I thought we behaved like kids today. When this happens, we need to learn and learn quick. Perform like today but behave much better.\" The result keeps Chelsea in ninth place on 47 points but only trailing the teams in front of them by three and with games in hand as they look to move up the table before the season finale on May 19.

Shi Tang/Getty Images The BWF Swiss Open kicks off the final 40 days of the qualification window that the Badminton World Federation [BWF] have set out for the Paris Olympics, and battles for a ticket to the big one are gaining pace now. The window, which started on May 1, 2023 will close on April 28, 2024. Before we proceed, though, a reminder of how many athletes will go to Paris -- 35 athletes each in the two singles events. If two athletes from the same country have to qualify, they both must be in the top 16 of the BWF Race to Paris (RTP) rankings by the end of April. Meanwhile, the list is shorter for doubles, with 16 teams each going to Paris across the three doubles disciplines. Only two teams per country are allowed, and that is only if the two teams are ranked in the top 8 of the RTP. We look at India's prospects discipline-wise, and with a sharper context of the upcoming BWF Swiss Open 2024 in mind: Men's Singles HS Prannoy's ticket to Paris is already booked, so his decision to take time off and focus on physical recovery makes sense. It's the second spot, though, where it gets tricky. Lakshya Sen is in the top 16, just. Ranked RTP #15 after two stunning runs to the semifinals in the French Open and All England Championship, he needs to keep his new-found momentum to stay within the qualification zone. The next closest Indian is Kidambi Srikanth, who's RTP #26. He needs to go on a strong run, starting at the Swiss Open, to seriously challenge for a spot. In Basel, Lakshya will start against Leon Jun Hao of Malaysia before a potential second-round match against the in-form Frenchman Christo Popov. Win that, and he could be in for a potential quarter against top-seed Lee Zii Jia (or Srikanth). Srikanth starts against Wang Tzu Wei before a likely second-round clash against LZJ. There's more Indian interest, though, with Priyanshu Rajawat (RTP #32) taking on fourth seed Lee Cheuk Yiu of Hong Kong and Kiran George (RTP #35) taking on Takuma Obayashi of Japan in the opening round. Women's Singles PV Sindhu is currently RTP #13 and with the next Indian ranked #40 (Aakarshi Kashyap), she should have a straightforward march to Paris. But after having shown glimpses of returning to her old self in Paris and Birmingham over the past fortnight, she'll want a deep run in Basel to keep that mojo going. Seeded fourth, she starts off with a clash against Yvonne Li (who retired hurt against Sindhu last week at All England). A win there and Japan's Tomoko Miyazaki awaits... but a tougher test would be in the quarters where she takes on Paris-chasing Aya Ohori (RTP #11, second-highest Japanese player, seven places below Akane Yamaguchi and just six above Nozomi Okuhara) or Paris-chasing Busanan Ongbamrungphan (RTP #20, one place below Pornapawee Chochuwong and six below Ratchanok Intanon) Aakarshi, meanwhile, starts with a tough draw against Michelle Li. Win that and one of Okuhara or Intanon await her in the second round. Men's Doubles World no. 1 Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty are RTP #2 and have their Paris berths sealed. They, like HSP, are skipping this tournament to focus on recovery. With that, there will be no Indian presence in MD at Basel. Path to Paris: After historic 2023, 'hungry' Sat-Chi embrace pressure, master the mind games Women's Doubles This here is a two-way battle between Tanisha Crasto-Ashwini Ponnappa (RTP #20) and Treesa Jolly-Gayatri Gopichand (RTP #26) to see who'll go. With only a max of two teams per country allowed, it is almost a certainty that whoever of Ash-Tan and Gaya-Tree finish the RTP higher will go to Paris. (For instance, China have five teams in the top 20, Japan have another five, South Korea have three). Ash-Tan begin their campaign against Rose-Puspitasari of Indonesia before a potential second-round match against Japan's Hirokami-Kato (RTP #30). On paper, the draw gives them a relatively straightforward run to the semis where they're likely to face top seeds (RTP #9) Rahayu-Ramadhanti of Indonesia. Incidentally, the top seeds get going against another Indian pair, the Panda sisters Rutuparna and Swetaparna (#48 in RTP). Gaya-Tree are on the other side of the draw and start against Annie and Kerry Xu of the USA, before a possible second-round meeting with compatriots Priya Konjengbam and Shruti Mishra (RTP #75). Their side of the draw is stacked with Paris-chasing Kusuma-Pratiwi (RTP #18, second-highest ranked Indonesian pair) a potential quarterfinal opponent and Denmark's Fruergaard-Thygsen (RTP #22) or Nakanishi-Iwanaga (RTP #12, fourth highest ranked Japanese team) potential semifinal opponents. Women's doubles is the most heavily represented event for Indians in Basel, with Ashwini Bhat - Shikha Gautam (RTP #59) making it five Indian pairs. Bhat-Gautam have a tough opener, taking on RTP #17 Yeung-Yeung of Hong Kong. Mixed Doubles There's no Indian participation at the Swiss Open, and there's next to no chance there will be Indian participation at the Olympics in this event - the highest ranked Indians are Satish Karunakaran and Aadya Variyath, and they're #44 in the RTP.\",\n",

       "               'text': \"2024 All England Championships takeaways: Lakshya's resurgence, Sindhu's positives, Sat-Chi's warning A return to basics has resulted in Lakshya Sen's uptick in form - with the Paris Olympics looming closer. Shi Tang/Getty Images Another All England Championship has come and gone and India's wait for another title at the oldest badminton tournament continues. 2024 had seemed a good chance to end the drought: especially with men's doubles top seeds Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty in red-hot form. However, they went out in the second round, as did PV Sindhu. Lakshya Sen, who reached the semifinals after a couple of stunning wins, was the last Indian standing while fellow men's singles players all lost in the first round. Here's a look at the takeaways for Indian badminton from 2024 All England, and what it means for the season ahead with the end of Paris Olympics qualifications on the horizon: Lakshya Sen rises again This All England marked a full circle, or rather, a triangle for Lakshya. Two years after his breakthrough, reaching the final of the 2022 edition, and two months after his lowest point on tour after seven straight first-round exits, Lakshya appears to have found his mojo back with two back-to-back semifinals. In Birmingham, he did a full 2022 throwback, beating world No 3 Anders Antonsen and 2021 champion Lee Zii Jia in tough three-game battles that brought out the best of his game - quick-footed and counterpunching, with the much-needed added element of composure. That he went down to Jonatan Christie in the semis may seem like a missed opportunity in an open field, but the 22-year-old has accomplished the much tougher task of overturning a mental slump. A deep run at a prestigious Super 1000 where the best players in the world struggled validates what his childhood coaches Vimal Kumar has been saying - physically his game was all there, it was a matter of confidence. The best part of this run is that the bounce was back in his step - he played a clean game with very good body language, something that had deserted him during his low period. This would have been the shot in the arm he needed, both for his game and his place in the race to Paris Olympics. Currently 15th in the BWF Race to Paris rankings, he needs to remain in the top 16 to qualify. Satwik-Chirag and men's doubles minefield The biggest upset from an Indian perspective was Satwik and Chirag losing in the second round in straight games. Muhammad Fikri and Bagas Maulana beat them 16-21, 15-21 to end their 5-match winning streak as well as their four-final run, playing a tactically smart game from the front court to outfox them. It wasn't a terrible result, though. They may have been the top seeds, but they lost to the 2022 All England champions, who then lost in the next round to the former world champions Soh-Chia. Meanwhile, the reigning world champions Seo-Kang lost in the first round and the second seeds Liang-Wang were also knocked out in the second round, by the reigning Olympic champions Lee-Wang. Simply put - this situation is reflective of the current men's doubles landscape, which has become increasingly competitive in the last couple of years and any pair can beat the other on their day. This in turn automatically makes player performance look more erratic that it is. Right now, there is not much to read into Satwik-Chirag's All England run except that they missed a major goal of 2024 - to reach the final of the Super 1000 they never have before. However, nothing motivates Satiwk-Chirag more than losses and this can add fuel to their fire in an important season. Sindhu has positives to count On paper, Sindhu had one walkover and lost the next match in Birmingham. On court, though, the second-round loss (19-21, 11-21) to world No 1 An Se Young is more than just an early exit. Yes, this was her seventh straight loss to the South Korean but it's a loss to take some heart from. Like in her loss to Olympic champion Chen Yu Fei at the French Open, Sindhu showed glimpses of her vintage self. She was quick on her feet, tactically more aware and played some brilliant shots to fight back and put herself in a good position against a tough opponent. This is more than she was able to throughout 2023, when she was coming back from a five-month injury layoff. Her comeback from the latest fourth-month injury layoff in February has started much better. Building up to the Paris Olympics, Sindhu raising hopes of returning to her pre-2022 surgery phase is one of the best takeaways for Indian badminton. What do we make of Prannoy's blip? HS Prannoy, who had the best year of his career in 2023, has been the only seeded Indian in singles for a while now by virtue of his consistency. In fact, he has already mathematically qualified for the Paris Olympics - his first ever - because of his steady run. However, the world no 8 has now lost three straight first-round matches on the BWF Tour, the last two to unheralded players. He reached the semifinal of the India Open Super 750 in January and won only one of three matches at the Badminton Asia Team Championship in February. It is too early to state if this a cause for concern and he himself must be disappointed with his loss -- having shared that his father has travelled to watch him at All England for the first time. He has not entered the next to BWF Super 300 events in Europe either, likely in an attempt at managing his fitness. Prannoy's form, though, is something to keep an eye on as the season progresses. The all-Indian women's doubles battle In women's doubles, there is an interesting battle brewing between Treesa Jolly and Gayatri Gopichand - who were the India No 1 pair for a long time before injury concerns pulled them behind in 2023 - and Tanisha Crasto and Ashwini Ponnappa, a newer pair who climbed up the ranks with a good end to 2023 - for the Paris Olympics qualification spot. This adds another layer to all their BWF World Tour performances. Currently, they are neck-to-neck at world No 22 and 23 in the world respectively but Tanisha-Ashwini are a little ahead at 11 to the other's 14 in the Olympics race. The top 16 spots usually qualify for the Olympics. At All England, Treesa and Gayatri lost in the first round, ending their streak of two straight semifinals, which will affect their points. Ashwini and Tanisha, meanwhile, beat a higher ranked pair and reached the second round of the Super 1000, which will give them a big boost. The cut-off is at the end of April, and this adds more intrigue to the Indian results in women's doubles.\",\n",

       "               'text': 'Jonatan Christie beats Lakshya Sen in three-game thriller, sets up All Indonesian final at 2024 All England Championships Jonatan Christie of Indonesia celebrates after winning the Men\\'s Singles Semi Final against Lakshya Sen of India at the All England Open Badminton Championships 2024 Catherine Ivill/Getty Images The All England Championships will see an All Indonesian men\\'s final in 2024 after Jonatan Christie beat India\\'s Lakshya Sen 21-12, 10-21, 21-15 to join Anthony Ginting (who beat France\\'s Christo Popov 19-21, 21-5, 21-11) in the title clash. In the second men\\'s semi of the day, Christie started rapidly.. flying out of the blocks. spraying his trademark jump smashes across Lakshya\\'s court (and body). It was close in the early stages, 6-6 as Lakshya kept up pace with the furious shot-making with some superb smashes of his own, but after opening up a four point lead at the mid-game break (11-7), Christie didn\\'t really look back. Some delightful touches at the net and those smashes directed at the body kept Lakshya guessing and there was little he could do as he closed the game out with the first of his eight game points, taking it 21-12. The second started similarly with a quick exchange of points but 3-2 for Lakshya became 6-3 and then Christie completely broke down. All his smashes went well wide, his drops found the net or drifted out of bounds, even his regulation clears were wayward. Those that remain inbounds were dispatched superbly by the alert Lakshya and from 6-3, he took an incredible 17-4 lead. A mini rally for Christie got him six more points but by then Lakshya had also drawn away, and he closed out the game 21-10. Considering how near-perfect Christie had been in the first game, this was a strange, sudden reversal that Lakshya took the utmost advantage of. Ahead of the third game, the great Prakash Padukone, travelling with Lakshya (and PV Sindhu), was heard giving him some advice: \"[Christie] will come out fast early on, you have to be prepared for it\". And prepared he was as he went 2-0 up, and then 5-3 up... by now he was controlling the pace and intensity of the rallies and relying on a combination of his patience and Christie\\'s wayward aggression to seize control of the game. Said control was short lived though as Christie changed up tactics to make it 6-6. He let go of the early smash-to-kill strategy that had won him the first game and lost him the second and adopted a more a patient approach, trusting his defence to open up gaps in Lakshya\\'s armour. By the time 7-7 became 8-8 and then 10-8 in favour of Christie, he knew he had the upper hand. Going into the decisive mid-game break 11-9 up, he opened up his full array of strokes again -- one in particular, where he leaned back and hit an overhand inside-out smash that flew down the line at an angle that Lakshya neither predicted nor could do anything about. That smash made it 16-12 for Christie and from there it was routine as he made it 20-12. Despite Lakshya\\'s late resistance saving three of those eight match points, Christie closed it out with a delicious drop angled cross-court. Lakshya\\'s loss, meanwhile, meant that was the end of India\\'s participation in Birmingham.

       "               'text': \"Lakshya Sen reaches All-England semifinal by returning to basics Lakshya Sen celebrates after winning the quarterfinal against Lee Zii Jia at the 2024 All England Badminton Championships. Catherine Ivill/Getty Images Two months ago, Lakshya Sen was mired in a terrible slump, looking lost after seven straight first-round exits on the BWF Tour. Today, Lakshya Sen has reached back-to-back semifinals in two straight weeks of the BWF Tour - at a Super 750 and Super 1000 tournament (the two highest tiers) looking supremely confident against some of the best players in the world. The 22-year-old Indian made the semis at the prestigious All England Championships after stunning comeback wins against world No. 3 Anders Antonsen and 2021 champion Lee Zii Jia in the span of two days. Against the Dane, he came back from a poor second game and 2-8 down in the decider to grab the final 8 points in his 24-22, 11-21, 21-14 win. Against the Malaysian, he fought back from a game down to win 20-22, 21-16, 21-19. The scoreline margins indicate how the final phase was a test of nerves as much as skill. Both times, he was the underdog and under pressure, both times he emerged victorious by being calm and playing his own game. Follow LIVE: Lakshya Sen vs Jonatan Christie The unseeded Indian showed the full range of his counter-punching prowess and speedy court-work, this time underlined by an exceptionally composed demeanour that has piled the pressure on his opponents as much as his skillful defence. He did that in Paris last week - where all his wins came from a game down - and he has backed it up in Birmingham, with the presence of childhood coaches Prakash Padukone and Vimal Kumar on the bench behind him. It's a complete U-turn and it's come at the best time possible - with the Paris Olympics looming closer. This Lakshya looks nothing like the dejected player at the India Open in January, plainly admitting that he was yet to process his latest loss to even think of the future. This Lakshya looked more like the 20-year-old breaking through the ranks back in 2022, reaching the final of All-England; beating Antonsen and Lee then as well. How did he turn it all around? In New Delhi, Vimal Kumar spoke about how Lakshya's issues were more mental than physical. His collapses stemmed from a lack of confidence rather than a technical glitch. The best way to solve them, the coach believed, was to not overthink but go back to his basics and put together a few wins. DIY: How childhood coach Vimal Kumar hopes Lakshya Sen can get his mojo back Conquering mental opponents is easier said than done but Lakshya has apparently managed to do just that. He is not only sticking to his basics of a quick, counter-punching game which can easily transition into attack when the opportunity arises, but he is doing it with complete confidence and composure. The 22-year-old did this multiple times against Lee, keeping the rallies on his racquet and forcing his opponent to do something extra while he remained steady. Lakshya was leading 8-3 to start the match before Lee reduced it to 9-8 and then levelled things at 12-12 and 16-16. They were battling it out in versatile rallies and smashed winners, with Lee often overhitting and Lakshya anticipating the errors. It was Lee who had three game points but Lakshya saved them all with great shots under pressure. On his fourth, he converted when Lakshya hit long - reiterating that the points were more often decided by the Indian's actions. The way Lee took the first game where Lakshya looked like the better player is a testament to the Malaysian's talent. Later however, the erratic tag that often describes him proved to be the difference. Lakshya, in the second game, stayed consistent and once again had the lead at the interval with more varied retrieving. The second half, however, was much closer with very small margins. Lee, looking to be the one to end points, committed a bunch of errors and got more cautious while Lakshya used the chance to force more mishits and eventually a decider. The Indian varied his pace and shots well to take charge of points. The decider was much tighter with no real lead to either player. But where Lee was sharp at the net and nailing smashes sporadically, Lakshya was constantly directing shots all over the court and had the interval lead once again as well as the momentum. The second half was not the cleanest of games but Lakshya's patience while Lee looked worried was a key difference. There was a superb rally at 13-16 where Lakshya won with his variety and smarts, a dogged defence ending with a smashed winner. Lee Zii Jia ���� competes against Lakshya Sen ���� in a hard-fought matchup.#BWFWorldTour #AllEngland2024 pic.twitter.com/wFqMCJh8G1 - BWF (@bwfmedia) March 16, 2024 But just as the Indian saw the finish line at 18-14, came the final twist as Lee levelled things at 19-19 with a cracking angled smash after a brief medical check for his arm. It was the moment of truth for Lakshya and those final 2 points went back to what coach Kumar had said so long ago. Lakshya forced Lee to mishit with quick parrying and then Lee pushed his return long, as he had so often in the match. Lakshya stuck to his basics and found confidence to reach the All-England semis once again - a full circle of sorts. Two years after his breakthrough and two months after his lowest point, Lakshya Sen discovered, or rather rediscovered, the core of what made him stand out as a badminton player. Next, he faces Jonathan Christie, whom he trails 1-2 in their head-to-head, for a place in the final. If he can continue playing his newfound old game, Lakshya can find something as precious at the oldest badminton tournament in the world.\",\n",

       "               'text': 'Sat-Chi and Sindhu headline India\\'s push to end drought at All England Championship File photo of Satwik and Chirag Photo by How Foo Yeen/Getty Images The All England Championship, long seen as badminton\\'s traditional holy grail - even after introduction of the World Championship and Olympic inclusion - holds a special significance in Indian badminton. Only two Indians have ever won the All England trophy - Prakash Padukone in 1980 and Pullela Gopichand in 2001. Incidentally, both will be at the 2024 edition, which starts on Tuesday in Birmingham, on the coach\\'s chair. Padukone has been travelling on tour since last week\\'s French Open Super 750, coaching PV Sindhu and Lakshya Sen, while Gopichand is the national coach with almost all other players. But it\\'s not just their presence that raises hope of that drought ending this year; it\\'s the performance of the world No 1 pair - Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty. Fresh from their dominant French Open title run on Sunday and having reached the final of all the BWF events they have played so far in 2024, the men\\'s doubles pair are overwhelming favourites for another first in Indian badminton. Being a Super 1000 tournament, the All England also offers a chance for crucial points in the Olympic qualification race and a chance to build on the momentum from Paris, where four Indians reached the quarterfinals. The draws in Birmingham are admittedly tough for most Indians and playing for the second straight week will need them to be at their best. Here\\'s a look at the Indian\\'s draw and chances at All England 2024: Men\\'s Doubles Satwiksairaj Rankireddy & Chirag Shetty vs Mohammad Ahsan & Hendra Setiawan Let\\'s switch things around and start with the discipline all eyes will be on to end India\\'s All England title drought. At the start of the year, Chirag had called this title one their 2024 goals: \"...that there are a couple of Super 1000s we haven\\'t medalled at, the All England is one major tournament we have not played a final yet.\" The path to the final, though, won\\'t be without big challenges. The top seeds face an interesting first-round battle - against the \\'Daddies\\', Mohammad Ahsan and Hendra Setiawan, who lead the Indians 4-3 and had beaten them the last time they played. In a way, this is a clash between the past and present of men\\'s doubles badminton as the Indonesian three-time world champions are 36 and 39 years of age, now unseeded against the most consistent pair of 2024. If Satwik and Chirag pass this early test, they could play 2022 champions Muhammad Shohibul Fikri and Bagas Maulana in the second round and former nemeses Aaron Chia and Soh Wooi Yik in the quarters. Men\\'s doubles is a highly competitive space and the Indians have been the best at this year, reaching the finals of all the Super 1000 and Super 750 events so far. Fresh off a title and a target to achieve, it\\'ll be hard not to see them as the favourites. Women\\'s Singles PV Sindhu vs Yvonne Li Aakarshi Kashyap vs Pai Yu-po Another Indian star who is yet to reach the final of All England is PV Sindhu. The former world champion has made a solid return from the injury layoff and was playing close to her best last week at the French Open, where she lost to reigning Olympic champion Chen Yu Fei in a very close quarterfinal. In Birmingham, she starts against Germany\\'s Yvonne Li, against whom she has a 2-0 record. But the real challenge comes early with a potential clash against world No 1 and defending champion An Se Young, whom she has never beaten before. Can the seventh time be the charm? Also in action will be Akarshi Kahsyap, who plays Pai Yu Po in the first round with a possible clash against eighth seed Han Yue if she reached the second. Men\\'s Singles HS Prannoy vs Su Li-yang Lakshya Sen vs Ng Tze Yong Srikanth Kidambi vs Viktor Axelsen Priyanshu Rajawat vs Chico Aura Dwi Wardoyo Lakshya, who rediscovered his touch with an impressive run to the semifinal last week, is the 2022 runner-up at All England and would want to build on his newly found momentum. He is slated to play Ng Tze Yong, who he has a solid 4-0 record against, but the Malaysian could withdraw. He faces a potential tricky second round against fourth seed Anders Antonsen. HS Prannoy, the only seeded Indian in singles, faced a first-round exit at the French Open to Lu Guang Zu, and will be keen to get going this week. He starts against Chinese Taipei\\'s Su Li-yang in what will be their first meeting. The other seed in his quarter is Li Shi Feng, who lost to Lakshya last week. Srikanth, who beat Chou Tien Chen but lost to Lu last week, has the most difficult draw on paper - facing top seed Viktor Axelsen. However, Axelsen has not been his formidable self this season and lost in the second round in Paris. If Srikanth has to make a big push for points, this is the time to upset the Dane who leads him 10-3. Priyanshu Rajawat starts against Chico Aura Dwi Wardoyo, who reached the semis in Paris and has beaten the Indian in their only meeting. A win will put him on collision course with second seed and French Open champion Shi Yu Qi. Women\\'s Doubles Treesa Jolly & Gayatri Gopichand vs Apriyani Rahayu & Siti Fadia Silva Ramadhanti Tanisha Crasto & Ashwini Ponnappa vs Yeung Nga Ting & Yeung Pui Lam Swetaparna Panda & Rutaparna Panda vs Rin Iwanaga & Kie Nakanishi Treesa Jolly and Gayatri Gopichand, still on the comeback trail after missing a large chunk of the last season, have had their best results on tour at the All England - reaching the semis in the last two editions. Looking for Olympic qualification, the 20-year-old will hope for a hattrick of deep runs. But a very tough draw awaits them, starting with Indonesian combination of Apriyani Rahayu and Siti Fadia Silva Ramadhanti who lead them 2-0. A win will pit them against eighth seeds Mayu Matsumoto and Wakana Nagahara while the inevitable world No 1 pair of Chen Qing Chen and Jia Yi Fan await in their quarter. The other women\\'s doubles pair of Tanisha Crasto and Ashwini Ponnappa, also looking for Olympic qualification, play Hong Kong\\'s Yeung Nga Ting and Yeung Pui Lam. The Indians beat them at the Badminton Asia Championship last month and will likely play fifth seeds Zhang Shu Xian and Zheng Yu if they win again. The Panda sisters, Rutaparna and Swetaparna, have also made the cut and start against Rin Iwanaga and Kie Nakanishi of Japan in what is their first meeting. A win means a second-round clash against second seeds Baek Ha Na and Lee So Hee.',\n",

       "               'text': 'Today\\'s NBA is harder on LeBron James, Steph Curry than ever before Sunday afternoon after a valuable victory for the Los Angeles Lakers in New Orleans, LeBron James asked aloud how many games he ended up playing in his just-concluded 21st NBA regular season. The answer was officially 71, but really 72 if counting the in-season tournament championship game which awkwardly isn\\'t counted. That\\'s 16 (17, unofficially) more games than last season and the most in his six-year tenure with the Lakers. James shook his head in satisfaction. \"That\\'s pretty cool,\" James said. \"At this point in my career to play 70-plus games and be available for my guys.\" This is reality. To be 39 years old, the oldest active player in the league, and dealing with some chronic injuries to his left ankle and right foot and long-term maintenance of other areas such as his lower back, to play that many games is indeed cool. The Lakers finished the regular season 47-35, four games better than last season, and James thought that was pretty good, too. \"To end the season 12 games over .500, 13 if you count the championship of in-season tournament, for everything we went through,\" James said, \"it\\'s a pretty good season for us.\" This is reality, too. The Lakers finished the season winning 13 of their last 18 games and slipped into eighth in the West at the finish line after spending months stuck in ninth or lower. But for James, reality is easily skewed. He doesn\\'t live in a world where \"good\" seasons are accepted at face value. He shares this status with 36-year-old Steph Curry, who will also compete in Tuesday\\'s play-in tournament. The Golden State Warriors will play the Sacramento Kings just after James takes on the New Orleans Pelicans as the West teams fight to gain entry to the playoffs. James and Curry are superstars of a certain age. Their dominance in their primes and extended run of winning at the highest level has made anything less than that seem like failure. Between 2011 and 2022, either James or Curry played in the Finals for 11 out of 12 years. They played against each other four times. Last season, they played in a series that smashed television ratings records as the Lakers won and James reached his 12th career conference finals. When this is your résumé, you aren\\'t afforded the luxury of simply maximizing your current team\\'s chances. James and Curry are judged aggressively both against ghost adversaries who have long retired and against themselves when they were younger, healthier and played in a less competitive league. \"This last 30 games has just been \\'Operation: Give ourselves a chance,\\'\" Curry said last week. \"You could look at it a lot of different ways. You could look at our record [down the stretch] and extrapolate that out for 82 games and you\\'re probably not in this situation. But all the things we\\'ve gone through and the way the West is stacked, that\\'s our situation. Doesn\\'t really matter.\" The Warriors were 19-24 in late January with Draymond Green suspended, Chris Paul injured and Klay Thompson stuck in a long slump. Stories leaked about role players undermining coach Steve Kerr, and Curry himself was quoting the definition of insanity. The Warriors then went 27-12 to finish the season. But if they lose one of their next two games, they will surely sit through a torrent of \"end of the road\" storylines. In 2016, when they blasted the league en route to 73 wins, the Warriors\\' current 46-36 record would\\'ve had them in the No. 5 seed. The conference\\'s depth now is totally different, and the margin for error is the tightest it has been in the past two decades. \"This whole season has been weird,\" Curry said. The Lakers just completed their second-best regular season in the past 13 years, behind only the 52-win season in 2019-20 that ended in a title. This season, if they have a bad week, James and the Lakers will deal with heavy fallout simply because of the expectations that have been established for the franchise. Like the Warriors, the Lakers will be awarded no bonus points based on a perspective that looks at the entire lay of the land. \"I took a lot of pride in the offseason in getting my foot, my ankle back in order, getting my body back in order,\" James said. \"And it\\'s definitely paid off for me.\" In addition to getting healthier, James adjusted his shooting form and finished the season at 41% from 3-point range, the best of his career. This will end up being a footnote to a footnote. Curry played in 74 games, his most in seven seasons. He had his 10th season of shooting at least 45% overall, 40% from 3 and 90% from the line. But there is next to no interest in this statistic -- Curry normalized great shooting years ago. Instead, he and James will eventually trudge off to the summer, likely listening to plenty of talk about how they\\'ve won their last NBA championships ... when they join up in Paris for Team USA in an attempt to win an Olympic gold medal. This is James and Curry\\'s existence. They are used to heavy expectations and doomsday predictions, and the presumption will be no different this week. \"You can\\'t avoid those conversations; they\\'ve been hovering over us [for years],\" Curry said Monday. \"When you\\'re out on the floor as a player performing at that level and understanding what\\'s expected of yourself and your team, that environment brings the best out of you.\"',\n",

Young -- the highest paid assistant in the NBA -- had been a significant candidate for league head coaching jobs in the past two hiring cycles, but BYU landed him with a sizable commitment to lead the Cougars into their second Big 12 Conference season and beyond. Young replaces Mark Pope, who left for the Kentucky job after delivering BYU an NCAA tournament bid in their inaugural Big 12 season. Young, who was born in Salt Lake City, will continue working with the Suns in the playoffs, but will begin assembling a coaching staff that'll immediately start recruiting for BYU, sources said. Young spent eight years coaching in the NBA G League -- including head-coaching jobs with the Utah Flash, Iowa Energy and Delaware 87ers. Young began to gain momentum as a head-coaching candidate in openings a year ago, including interviews with the Milwaukee Bucks, Toronto Raptors, Houston Rockets and Suns. Young previously interviewed for head-coaching jobs with the Philadelphia 76ers, Utah Jazz and Washington Wizards. The Charlotte Hornets and Brooklyn Nets interviewed him for jobs this spring too, sources said. Young started his coaching career in 2007 as an assistant at Utah Valley University.\",\n",

Fernandez, 41, has been a fast-rising coaching candidate in the past two years and will land the Nets' head-coaching job, sources said. Fernandez will take over a Nets franchise that completed a 32-50 season under interim coach Kevin Ollie -- its fifth coach since 2020. Brooklyn is reshaping its team in the post-Kevin Durant-Kyrie Irving era and is hiring Fernandez to reinvigorate a roster that includes Mikal Bridges, Cam Thomas, Nic Claxton, Cameron Johnson and Noah Clowney. Nets general manager Sean Marks met with dozens of candidates in recent weeks and Fernandez advanced to meet with owner Joe Tsai recently, sources said. Fernandez will continue to coach the Kings for the rest of the season, sources said. Sacramento plays the Warriors in Tuesday's Western Conference 9-10 play-in tournament game. Fernandez was part of 2023 NBA Coach of the Year Mike Brown's revival with the Kings and began building his head-coaching candidacy in stops with Denver for six seasons under Michael Malone and with the Cleveland Cavaliers. Fernandez's medal-winning work as the Canadian national coach at the 2023 FIBA World Cup made league executives begin to examine him further as one of the league's top young assistants.

       "               'text': '\\n\\nIs 2024 the year of health-conscious pancakes?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe surge in free-from products stands as a notable trend reshaping consumer preferences. Amidst changing dietary attitudes and growing health consciousness with the introduction of HFSS, brands like OaYeah! who make oat-drink based pancakes have capitalised on this shift.\\n\\n\\nA recent survey by BakeAway has shed light on generational disparities in dietary preferences, with Gen Z emerging as champions of the free-from movement. A remarkable 84 percent of Gen Z individuals express an intention to explore or adopt free-from diets in 2024, driven primarily by health considerations.\\n However, taste remains a significant factor, with 41 percent expressing hesitation due to past flavour experiences.\\n\\n\\nMillennials also exhibit a growing interest in free-from diets, particularly for breakfast options. With 63 percent considering the switch for health benefits,\\n this demographic represents a lucrative market segment characterised by a proactive approach to wellness. Their receptiveness to nutritious alternatives underscores the potential for innovation in this space.\\n\\n\\nIn February 2023 BakeAway launched OaYeah! a HFSS compliant readymade pancake brand made from oat-drink and with 45 percent less fat and sugar than regular readymade pancakes. This exemplifies BakeAway’s strategic response to shifting consumer preferences.\\n\\n\\nBy introducing a HFSS compliant oat-based pancake brand tailored to those looking for a convenient healthy breakfast, BakeAway has tapped into a burgeoning demand for alternative breakfast options. OaYeah! addresses both health and taste concerns, offering consumers a delicious health-conscious option without compromising on flavour.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDespite promising growth, challenges persist in addressing taste perceptions and ensuring widespread accessibility. The success of brands like OaYeah! hinges on their ability to navigate these challenges while delivering on consumer expectations for both taste and health benefits.\\n\\n\\nIn addition to health considerations, environmental consciousness plays a pivotal role in shaping consumer choices, particularly among younger demographics. Millennials and Gen Z exhibit a heightened awareness of sustainability issues, influencing their purchasing decisions and brand loyalty. OaYeah!’s commitment to sustainability through the use of oat-based ingredients resonates with eco-conscious consumers, reinforcing its appeal in a competitive market.\\n\\n\\nEncouraging older demographics to embrace free-from or reduced-dairy foods to prioritise sustainability and health presents more of a challenge for the industry. It requires increased focus on delivering a multifaceted approach in comparison to younger consumers. Firstly, providing educational materials and demonstrations can introduce them to these concepts and highlight the benefits of incorporating healthier and sustainable products into their diets.\\n\\n\\nOaYeah! emphasises the delicious flavours, high-quality ingredients, and health benefits of its oat-drink based pancakes. This approach can help the food and beverage industry to overcome taste and quality concerns and maximise profit. That being said, more brands within the market need to take this approach to garner recognition from this challenging demographic.\\n\\n\\nAdditionally, ensuring easy accessibility of these products in mainstream grocery stores and online platforms, along with transparent labelling of sustainability credentials, can make them more appealing to older consumers. By implementing these strategies, businesses can effectively cater to the unique preferences and needs of older demographics, encouraging them to embrace free-from foods and sustainability in their food choices.\\n\\n\\nConvenience has become a key driver in shaping all consumer choices, not just older generations, particularly in the fast-paced lifestyles of today\\n.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0OaYeah!’s chilled, ready-to-eat oat-based pancakes can be ready in minutes, offering a hassle-free solution for busy individuals seeking a nutritious breakfast option. With the ability to be microwaved in minutes, these pancakes cater to consumers’ desire for quick and easy meal solutions without compromising on taste or quality.\\n\\n\\nThis convenience factor has undoubtedly contributed to the success of OaYeah!, as it aligns with the needs and preferences of modern consumers. Food manufacturers looking to replicate this success should prioritise convenience in their product offerings, focusing on creating innovative solutions that streamline meal preparation and cater to consumers’ on-the-go lifestyles.\\n\\n\\nBy providing convenient options that deliver on taste, quality, and nutritional value, manufacturers can meet the evolving demands of today’s consumers and carve out a competitive edge in the free-from and health focussed market.\\n\\n\\nAs consumer awareness of dietary choices expands, the demand for transparency in food labelling and sourcing practices grows. Brands like OaYeah! have an opportunity to further solidify their market presence by emphasising their commitment to ethically sourced ingredients and sustainable production methods.\\n\\n\\nThe ascent of free-from products reflects broader shifts towards mindful consumption and wellness. Through strategic adaptation and a nuanced understanding of consumer preferences, industry professionals can harness this momentum to drive growth and innovation in the food and beverage sector.\\n\\n\\nSales of free-from and HFSS compliant products are expected to rise over the long term, presenting opportunities for innovation and market expansion. While challenges persist, brands like OaYeah! demonstrate the potential for success in meeting evolving consumer needs while contributing to a healthier and more sustainable future.\\n\\n\\nThis underscores the importance of continuous research and development efforts aimed at creating new and improved free-from offerings that cater to diverse dietary requirements and preferences.\\n\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "               'text': '\\n\\nIs the plant-based bubble bursting?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe proportion of UK consumers purchasing plant based alternative food and drink products has near enough doubled in the last decade and the pandemic acted as a catalyst for even quicker growth with fear of a shortage of meat and dairy products and factory closures increasing vegan product sales. At the same time, consumers were reportedly swapping to plant-based alternatives in an effort to boost natural immunity.\\n\\n\\nIncreasingly environmentally conscious consumers and a growing investor appetite for plant-based research and development led to significant opportunities for plant-based businesses. This was reflected in the number of merges and acquisition (M&A) transactions in the plant-based sector, with deal volumes steadily increasing and all signs pointing to this boom continuing.\\n\\n\\nDecreasing demand\\n\\n\\nFast forward to today and the plant-based environment certainly seems more challenging with regular instances of brands withdrawing or decreasing product ranges. Investment in the plant based sub-sector counted for six percent of all food and drink transactions in 2022, and further reduced to just four percent in the first half of 2023. It raises the question: has the vegan bubble burst? The answer is more complicated than the question suggests and is subject to a variety of factors.\\n\\n\\nThe rapid expansion of the plant based sub-sector in the early 2020s has seemingly resulted in an overcrowded market, with supply outstripping demand. The recent performance could possibly be a sign of the sector “correcting” itself post pandemic. In any event, the plant-based market is a relatively new market and it is therefore fairly inevitable that it will see peaks and troughs as it establishes itself and stabilises.\\n\\n\\nThe cost-of-living crisis has also had a big impact on the plant-based sector, particularly for branded vegan products. Vegan products are often seen as more expensive than meat or dairy alternatives, with our survey stating that 54 percent of UK adults consider this to be the case. It is reported that the cost-of-living crisis has impacted consumer willingness to purchase what are considered “expensive” vegan products, where meat and dairy alternatives are cheaper. Branded vegan products are doubly affected by the cost-of-living crisis, as it is reported that some consumers hunt for supermarket own-brand alternatives of plant-based products to cut costs.\\n\\n\\nLooking at the plant-based food landscape provides various examples of decreasing consumer interest and reducing product lines: this year our survey found that one in four UK adults have noticed that there are fewer options for plant-based products in supermarkets.\\n\\n\\nThe high inflation, rising interest rates couple with geopolitical tension and supply disruptions, economic uncertainty, labour shortages and temperamental weather all contribution to the decrease in the volume of M&A activity in the food & drink sector as a whole, with plant-based transactions not avoiding the same fate.\\n\\n\\nWhat next?\\n\\n\\nIn the context of a slowdown in merger & acquisition activity amongst food & drink manufacturers, companies will need to have a strategy to expand market share and diversify product portfolios as well as investing in innovative technologies such as digital and automated process that offer higher productivity levels and are less impacted by persistent labour shortages.\\n\\n\\nCompanies with a strong financial position and private equity investors may view the current landscape as an opportune time to acquire emerging plant-based brands, especially those with innovative products or strong market niches.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nManufacturers may also assess their pricing strategies, with cost already being noted as a significant factor for consumers. Since 39 percent of UK adults claimed to be discouraged from purchasing plant-based products due to cost, it is suggested that manufacturers explore more cost-effective production methods, incorporate digital or automated processes, or focus on products with higher price elasticity.\\n\\n\\nAlthough merger & acquisition activity may not be as explosive as experienced in 2021 and subsequently anticipated, a greater investor focus on innovative technologies could result in a steady flow of merger & acquisition activity.\\n\\n\\nIncreasing predictions of consumers adopting a flexitarian lifestyle in the coming future also suggest a continuing (although not rapidly expanding) market for plant based alternatives and opportunities for innovation. In fact, Sainsburys predicts that 50 percent of UK consumers will be flexitarian by 2025, and it is predicted that the global vegan market may be worth as much as £50 billion by 2030.\\n\\n\\nSales of vegan products are therefore still expected to rise over the long term however the increases and M&A activity may not be as explosive as many initially anticipated, with a greater focus from investors on innovative technologies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

In 2021, it contributed almost 4 percent of the world’s CO2 emissions, with reductions creeping along at just 0.7 percent per year, a far cry from what’s urgently needed .\\n\\n\\nDrinks brands and their partners are now tasked with a radical overhaul that will require an all-hands-on-deck approach to rapidly slash high energy bills and hit looming 2030 and 2050 emissions targets. For starters, partnering up to tackle scope three supply chain emissions is key. Inside the companies themselves, aligning strategies with clear emission goals is vital. This might mean new technology investments, updating operational processes or using data tools to track emission reductions.\\n\\n\\nThis article delves into the transformative journey ahead, exploring innovative partnerships, cutting-edge technology, and strategic shifts within the industry that could redefine its environmental footprint and set a new standard in sustainability.\\n\\n\\nAre current initiatives more than just talk?\\n\\n\\nBig players in the beverage world are already stepping up their game with green initiatives, like Carlsberg’s fibre-based bottles, which the brand claim could slash emissions by up to 80 percent compared to single-use glass bottles. Similarly, Pepsi’s new sustainability platform, ‘Partners for Tomorrow’, is a step in the right direction, unifying its environmental efforts, including its CIRQU recycling programme. We’re also seeing companies publicly share emissions targets, including Coca Cola’s 2030 science-based target to reduce absolution emissions by 25 percent compared with 2015 .\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThese changes are encouraging, but they have to truly deliver on green promises, not just a marketing ploy. Coca Cola is a brand that spent more than $4.3 billion in advertising in 2022\\xa0 so any targets and ambitions must be taken with a pinch of salt. But here’s the catch: it’s not just about reducing emissions. There’s a balance to strike between being eco-friendly and retaining product quality. For instance, switching from classic materials like glass to paper needs to nail the practicality, brand image, and cost trifecta. It’s a tricky balance between green benefits, what the customer wants and what the planet needs.\\n\\n\\nAddressing external pressures\\n\\n\\nThe beverage industry is also feeling the heat from external sources such as stricter EU regulations and global commitments arising from COP28. The rules of the game are constantly changing, most recently with the EU’s Green Claims Directive\\xa0 introducing a push for more detailed claims about emissions and offsets. In response to growing frustration over greenwashing, companies need to back up their environmental messaging with hard facts, ahead of flashy marketing around contentious carbon offsets.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe’ve seen this growing caution manifest in the last few years; for example, Nestlé’s step back from using carbon offsets for brands like KitKat and Nespresso. The pressure is on for brands to avoid legal action. People are also voting green with their wallets as sustainability is an increasingly big draw for customers who want products with smaller carbon footprints, sustainable packaging, and ethical production lines.\\n\\n\\nThe supply chain challenge\\n\\n\\nWrestling supply chain emissions (92 percent of the emissions pie) offers another golden opportunity to dial down environmental impact. It’s a mammoth task to say the least. Plastic packaging is the EU’s main source of plastic waste, with food and beverages making up two fifths of it. Meanwhile, data from 2022 suggests a European beverage manufacturer would have to fork out an extra 20 percent of costs to only use recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) for its bottles.\\n\\n\\nBusinesses are tweaking their processes to reduce water and energy use as well as waste. However to enact change fast enough, we need to see more of a push for collaboration and joint eco-friendly investments. The Beverage Industry Environmental Roundtable is a great example of how the industry can come together to pool resources. Sharing know-how is key, especially for smaller suppliers who might need a hand in greening up their operations. It’s also an opportunity to strengthen ties with other business and provide long-term stability.\\n\\n\\nThis means having a clear strategy in place to achieve net-zero goals that will offer a framework and benchmark for businesses and their partners to score themselves against. While this may sound daunting, brands which are transparent about their emissions whilst looking to improve their green credentials and processes are more attractive to current and future partners.\\n\\n\\nTechnology and innovation: The new frontier\\n\\n\\nFortunately, the beverage industry is getting a tech makeover to tackle its environmental challenges. Take rapid chilling drinks coolers. These nifty devices reduce electricity use and carbon footprint of bars and retail outlets by substituting 24 hour refrigeration for on-demand chilling, offering energy savings of 50-90 percent compared to traditional refrigeration methods. The industry’s diving into other smart refrigeration methods too, including alternative, planet-friendly refrigerants to further reduce emissions from the ‘cold chain’ – the journey drinks take while staying cool.\\n\\n\\nIt’s not stopping at refrigeration either; the entire production line is getting smarter. Companies are switching to energy-efficient machines and tapping into renewable energy. Smart factories are deploying high-tech sensors to track machine elements like performance and temperature to ensure kit on the factory floor is working at optimal efficiencies. Artificial intelligence (AI) and the internet of things (IoT) are playing growing roles here, helping to autonomously act on performance data. The global electrification drive is another green catalyst, offering more sustainable electric delivery vehicles, smarter routing software and AI-driven supply chain management.\\n\\n\\nPackaging’s also getting a high-tech boost. The shift from traditional materials to greener alternatives like biodegradable and recycled alternatives is accelerating. While sustainability has a reputation for being more expensive, brands can actually cut cost by saving on energy or by using recycled materials. Used drinks cans in Europe are actually 20 percent cheaper than new aluminium. Forward-thinking brands will go one step further and shout about these innovations to customers to encourage them to drink more sustainably, creating a positive feedback mechanism that drives further investment in new technology.\\n\\n\\nA glass half full\\n\\n\\nThe beverage industry stands at a pivotal moment in the face of tightening green legislation, evolving consumer demands and economic headwinds. With technological innovations, a push towards sustainable practices, and increasing external pressures, it’s more than just a race against climate change; it’s now about realising a transformational shift in operations and ethos. The industry is embracing change, but the real test lies in delivering on green promises while balancing quality, cost and speed.\\n\\n\\nSmarter production, eco-friendly packaging, and collaborative supply chain strategies are many of the tools available. But to make the most of these, brands need clear environmental goals that will hold them and their partners accountable for any shortcomings. The future of our world depends on the drinks industry ensuring business success and environmental responsibility are not just aligned, but inseparable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "               'text': '\\n\\nHow manufactures can reduce food waste during food production\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) had released a report that revealed \\ncomes from manufacturers and production plants that haven’t optimised processes to handle their waste. This backups the importance of food businesses to monitor where they produce the most waste to then implement a strategy to deal with it accordingly.\\n\\n\\nWith that in mind, Andrew Powles, Managing Director of \\n provider FPE Seals has provided his insight for key areas in which food waste could be reduced during production.\\n\\n\\nForecasting accurately\\n\\n\\nThe first place to start is to monitor and analyse existing data to gain knowledge on your products and the waste that you produce, which is essential for building out your waste management strategy and reducing what’s generated. If you analyse the amount of waste that comes from raw materials when producing their products and compare against hod much is sold will help form up a greater picture of the amount of ingredients, you need to order to meet your demands.\\n\\n\\nThere are technologies that exist, like data collection services that can provide a more accurate forecasts that will help optimise your processes better.\\n\\n\\nImprove your packaging quality\\n\\n\\nTo significantly improve the life of food, is to implement better quality packaging. This should be prioritised to reduce waste not only within the supply chain but domestically too. Top-quality packaging throughout the manufacturing chain will also reduce contamination through handling.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThroughout history, packaging uses plastic due to its durability and how well it protects against deterioration when sealed properly. Estimates from the UK government find that more than \\n is introduced to the consumer market annually.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nDespite recyclable plastic technology is improving, it’s still crucial for producers in the manufacturing chain to find a good balance between using plastics that not only preserve food but don’t also contribute to landfill Labelling use by and best before dates should also be included visibly on your packaging, as well as advice on properly storing the product for the longest shelf life.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nInvest in quality assurance and control\\n\\n\\nNot all products are perfect, however if you invest more time into quality assurance and control within the production process, than this can help reduce your waste output. Under and overcooked food needs to be disposed of, but it creates more waste, and having quality products made from the start reduces this risk.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nInvesting in appropriate resources and training your quality control team, can be a great way to ensure your processes are optimised. This can even include integrating automation of more mundane processes to give the workers more time to ensure the quality of your products.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nTraining and transparency\\n\\n\\nIf you conduct appropriate training and encourage transparency across your team around the importance of food waste, this will ensure everyone is invested in the right area. This can be done internally by any training and knowledge department you might have or by bringing in a third-party educator to provide insight into the larger effects of food waste.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nIf you educate your staff about the harmful effects of landfill emissions and chemical contamination, that can obstruct the growth of food production, you’ll accommodate a more positive company culture that share the same attitude towards food waste.\\n\\n\\nWith this education, not only will your staff feel invested in, they’d also be able to communicate problems within processes that they gain perspective on that can help further optimise your food waste. These habits will help to build positive values and habits in your business.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nFurthermore, providing your team with the latest technologies and training them to operate them can help improve all aspects of food production.\\n\\n\\nSources\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

The United Nations (UN) has projected the figure to climb even higher – to 9.7 billion by 2050.\\n\\n\\nIf we continue to produce, supply and consume food in the same ways, we will need the resources of not only one but \\n Planet Earths to feed nearly 10 billion people adequately.\\n\\n\\nNeedless to say, there is no Planet B, or for that matter Planet C. To solve the challenge of sustaining everyone on our one and only planet, the food industry must play a critical role – we need to innovate sustainable nutrition solutions that provide healthy diets to people while minimising the environmental impact.\\n\\n\\nIn this article, I will discuss the challenges of the global food system and explore how the food industry can drive change through sustainable nutrition innovations.\\n\\n\\nChallenges of the global food system\\n\\n\\nThe global food system is grappling with complex and interlinked challenges that affect the health of people and the planet.\\n\\n\\nWith the prevalence of unhealthy diets and sedentary lifestyles, obesity has almost tripled worldwide since 1975. Now, two billion men, women and children are overweight or obese and at higher risk of non-communicable diseases like Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.\\n\\n\\nYet, at the same time, over 700 million people are hungry or undernourished, with limited access to affordable and nutritious food due to poverty, climate change or war and conflict.\\n\\n\\nDespite many lacking the food and nutrients they need to support health, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that one-third of all food produced – over 1.3 billion tons – is lost or wasted annually. This food is thrown away either on the way from farms to markets, or in homes, retail or food service, before people have a chance to eat it.\\n\\n\\nFood loss and waste hurt the planet’s health too. All the resources put into production, such as water, energy, land and labour, are wasted when the food does not eventually reach consumers. Moreover, food waste discarded into landfills decomposes and emits methane, a greenhouse gas, contributing to global warming.\\n\\n\\nIn fact, according to naturefood.com, the global food system is responsible for more than 30 percent of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. The contributions come from the entire supply chain, from agricultural activities, transport and processing to packaging, retail and disposal.\\n\\n\\nRise of the AND consumer\\n\\n\\nIncreasingly, consumers recognise what they eat impacts their health and the environment. They have leaned into sustainability with their actions:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis rising class of consumers, known as AND consumers, places increasing importance on personal health and planetary well-being. The products they buy must meet multiple criteria – tasty \\n healthier \\n convenient \\n affordable \\n sustainable.\\n\\n\\nCreating healthier food environments\\n\\n\\nWhile consumers are taking a stand on sustainability, governments face mounting pressure to monitor and regulate their food supply to create healthier food environments for their people.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExcessive sodium intake is a significant risk factor for stroke, heart disease, some cancers and premature death. According to the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019, an estimated 1.89 million diet-related deaths each year are linked to excessive sodium intake.\\n\\n\\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends less than 5 grams of salt per day, but the global average salt intake is estimated to be at least double that at 10.8 grams per day.\\n\\n\\nEven though the WHO has set a global target of reducing sodium intake by 30 percent by 2025, its Global Report on Sodium Intake Reduction noted that the world is still off track as of 2023 to achieve this target.\\n\\n\\nCurrently, only 27 percent of the world’s population live in countries with mandatory measures for sodium reduction. The main reason is that most governments have yet to adopt compulsory policies and have left businesses to reduce sodium in food products voluntarily.\\n\\n\\nAccording to WHO, in the Middle East, North Africa and Turkiye (MENAT) region, only a handful of countries – Bahrain, Iran, Qatar, Turkiye, United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia – have introduced mandatory measures to reduce sodium or help consumers make healthier food choices with compulsory labelling of sodium content on all pre-packaged food.\\n\\n\\nSaudi Arabia has gone one step further by implementing the WHO’s recommended interventions related to sodium that help prevent non-communicable diseases. These interventions include:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDiets high in refined carbohydrates and sugar contribute to overweight and obesity. In the WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean Region, for example, 53 percent of adult women and 45 percent of adult men are overweight or obese. The region also has the highest rate of diabetes at nearly 14 percent of the population.\\n\\n\\nThe WHO has set a target for the MENAT region to reduce obesity in children and adults by 35 percent. It has recommended that governments implement nutrition labelling that supports healthy choices and monitor the food environment for nutritional quality, prices, and marketing practices.\\n\\n\\nOnly a few countries within the region have introduced traffic light labelling on food products. The label indicates the sugar, salt and fat levels to help consumers make healthier food choices. Iran has made such labelling mandatory, while Saudi Arabia has made it voluntary.\\n\\n\\nSeveral countries in the region, including Saudi Arabia and UAE, have also rolled out a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages. Saudi Arabia, in particular, has seen encouraging results following a sugar tax of 50 percent – a 35 percent reduction in the sales of carbonated beverages.\\n\\n\\nHow the food industry can drive change\\n\\n\\nThe planet’s wellbeing is in jeopardy. Countries face public health crises despite some measures to stem obesity and prevent non-communicable diseases. And consumers increasingly seek sustainable products that benefit them and the environment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt Kerry, we work with our customers to help them move along the sustainable nutrition spectrum where they can produce healthier, tasty foods while cutting carbon emissions and food waste. The range and complexity of challenges our industry is facing right now is unprecedented and there is an urgency for the food industry to step up and proactively develop sustainable nutrition solutions. How then can the food industry make a meaningful difference by creating sustainable nutrition solutions?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConsumers are becoming more conscious of eating healthier diets. Governments are introducing taxes and regulations on products high in fat, sugar and salt to tackle obesity and prevent non-communicable diseases.\\n\\n\\nThe food industry is hence feeling the heat to reformulate existing products. The good news is that manufacturers can now leverage available taste modulation technology such as Kerry’s \\n to successfully reduce sugar and salt to meet nutritional guidelines while retaining their products’ appealing taste.\\n\\n\\nFood manufacturers can also use digital tools in the market such as the\\xa0 \\n to predict how changes in ingredients or recipes will affect their products’ nutritional profiles.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne way to address the issue of food waste is by developing products with a longer shelf life. Take, for example, bakeries. Bakeries create a lot of waste due to the short shelf life of bakery goods.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nBy creating more resilient and longer-lasting products, such as with enzymes and fermented ingredients, food manufacturers can eliminate visual discards and help reduce emissions associated with landfill waste. Kerry’s \\n helps companies and individuals quantify the impacts of food waste.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWith health and sustainability at the top of their minds, more consumers are opting for nutrient-dense plant-based alternatives that also come with lower greenhouse gas emissions.\\n\\n\\nStill, taste is the number one reason consumers favour one product over another. To appeal to a broad range of consumers with varying dietary needs and demands, food manufacturers must develop \\n that offer the same desirable taste, texture, functionality and nutrition as animal-based counterparts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOver the past decade there has been a proliferation of front of pack nutrition labelling globally (e.g., NutriScore, Traffic Light Label and Health star rating) which aim to guide and inform consumers to make healthier food choices at the point of purchase. More recently, eco-labels are also entering the market with front of pack ratings to help consumers to understand the environmental impact of their purchases.\\n\\n\\nEven though there are challenges in standardisation and consumers may still need more education to fully understand what the labels mean, these labels are still a useful tool for educating consumers on the health and environmental impact of their purchases.\\n\\n\\nNutritional and eco labelling may also motivate producers to create better-for-health food, reduce their carbon footprints and develop sustainable products.\\n\\n\\nCollaboration is key\\n\\n\\nThe world faces complex and urgent challenges in global health and environmental sustainability. We can no longer wait on or rely on a single party to take action.\\n\\n\\nAs the food industry seeks to respond to these challenges in addition to regulatory and consumer demands, it makes sense to collaborate with partners that can support them in creating products that deliver even more value in sustainable nutrition.\\n\\n\\nThe food industry must thus unite to innovate in sustainable nutrition. This shift is essential not just for consumer and planetary health but also for economic benefits. Collaborative efforts are vital to making a more meaningful impact, creating foods that are better for people, society and the planet.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Understanding the full supply chain and the food safety risks associated with it will determine the strategy to control and mitigate risks. And it’s something that needs to be monitored closely and carefully, especially as deviations can occur at any point in the supply chain at any time. That makes food safety monitoring systems crucial in managing risk and keeping quality consistent.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nBut that also takes time. Across the food industry, thousands of hours are spent every year ensuring that the food ingredients created for consumers to enjoy is being produced to the highest standards. Finding more efficient, reliable ways to monitor food safety is top of any manufacturer’s list, especially when speed and efficiency are crucial in keeping production lines running and customers supplied. As global supply chains face numerous pressures, any way to improve productivity and reliability can help the food industry deliver for consumers. That’s where innovation comes in.\\n\\n\\nEmerging technologies are creating exciting possibilities for food safety. The quicker food quality or safety issues are flagged up, the quicker they can be resolved. New technology can not only help improve the speed and accuracy of food quality monitoring but also enhance the traceability of food supply chains, which are often complex and challenging to navigate. It’s still early days for the industry, but at ofi, we have been testing different approaches.\\n\\n\\nTake our laboratory testing facility in Koog aan der Zaan in the Netherlands. Previously, we captured measurements from the equipment used to process cocoa ingredients manually, which was relatively time-consuming. By introducing a laboratory information management system (LIMS) where the equipment captures data directly and feeds it into our systems, it removes the need for manual data capture. This means we can collect the measurements we need much more regularly and quickly. We’ve also improved the speed of our analysis by using more infrared equipment technology (NIRs) across many of our cocoa processing sites. Where one measurement previously took 30-45 minutes, it now takes only five minutes. That means we can take more measurements and capture more reliable data as a result.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the real potential of these technologies lies in what can be achieved if they are scaled. With data captured all in one system, we can perform quicker traceability between the farm and the factory.\\n\\n\\nLikewise, we are looking to install additional NIRs at our cocoa facilities to complement our existing systems. The more sensors we can install will help us build a better picture of our operations – and in doing so, help improve product quality for our customers.\\n\\n\\nIncreasing the amount of data, we are able to capture across our supply chain also opens up exciting possibilities for AI. As we capture more data, we will also need to be able to process more information in real-time. AI systems will one day be able to do just that, helping us build an even more accurate and powerful food safety system.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nTake one example of a common issue that can affect cocoa bean quality: wet weather conditions. If the weather in a cocoa-sourcing country is particularly wet, it can affect the levels of Free Fatty Acids (FFAs) in the final product. In fact, if the FFA levels are too high, the final product will have an unpleasant taste and be unsuitable for use. That’s where AI comes in. In the future, AI tools could help process real-time food quality measurements from our processing facilities across the globe, alongside data on weather conditions at the beans’ origin. This analysis could help us estimate the quality of the finished product and adjust our processing accordingly, ultimately helping us to better plan, predict inconsistencies, reduce waste, and enhance the traceability of our supply chain.\\n\\n\\nTechnology is clearly changing the game in food quality and safety and is creating some exciting possibilities to improve safety and efficiency across the supply chain. As technology improvements allow us to better harness data across our supply chain, we will be able to better monitor and improve food quality from plant to palate. That will not only help improve the speed and accuracy of our operations but also help deliver a higher quality and more consistent product for consumers to enjoy.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Five food trend predictions for 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s the start of a new year which, for \\n, means looking ahead to the next twelve months and predicting what trends will dominate the food and beverage industry in 2024.\\n\\n\\nThis year, \\n Grace Galler has called on various members of the \\nAdvisory Board who have been keeping their ear firmly to the ground in order to understand exactly how the food and beverage landscape will shape up in 12 months ahead.\\n\\n\\nThere is no crystal ball to determine what the trends the food sector will be well accustomed to come December 2024, but there is research and experts in the field to help up better understand the evolving preferences, innovations, and societal shifts that will likely define the industry.\\n\\n\\nSo what will be taken off the menu this year? And how might preferences be changing? Let’s investigate.\\n\\n\\nA gut feeling about probiotics\\n\\n\\nAt the start of every year, many consumers turn their attention to health and nutrition. With \\n predicting that “healthy ageing will be redefined by debunking ‘old’ stigmas and prioritising extending consumers’ healthy years”, what’s poised to experience a surge in interest throughout 2024?\\n\\n\\nGut health had been a \\n on Google during 2023, with interest significantly rising in the last quarter of the year. Thanks to an increasingly informed consumer base prioritising wellness, there has already been a surge in products tailored to support digestive health.\\n\\n\\nProbiotics, prebiotics, and functional foods may well take centre stage in the months ahead, products that offer a diverse array of options aiming to balance and nourish the gut microbiome. From fermented foods like kimchi and kombucha to innovative probiotic-infused snacks and beverages, the evolving market reflects an interest in promoting gut well-being.\\n\\n\\nWith \\n from the likes of the Global Prebiotic Association highlighting that “probiotics, prebiotics and polyphenols have been shown to benefit the microbiota and to reduce risk of CVD”, education surrounding this trend is plentiful and allows consumers to consider the potential link between gut health and overall wellness.\\n\\n\\nSterling Crew, President of the Institute of Food Science and Technology (IFST) and \\n Advisory Board Member agrees that gut health is likely to take centre stage in 2024: “I have a gut feeling that we will see the emergence of the microbiome being a driver in new food development.\\n\\n\\n“In recent years it has become a key increasingly clear that a gut full of friendly microbes is vital for our good health. We are gathering greater knowledge about how our gut microbiome and food affects our mood and general health. Scientists are still learning about exactly how food influences us but it does seems like the gut microbiome plays a major part.”\\n\\n\\n“With products which have over five billion live cultures from 14 strains of bacteria. I believe this type of development will become new mega trend in the future.”\\n\\n\\nTastes from around the world\\n\\n\\nIngredients aren’t just components anymore. They are a gateway to exploring tastes from all four corners of the earth and, in 2024, its likely that consumers will continue to explore and embrace an eclectic array of international tastes and culinary traditions.\\n\\n\\nSeeking authenticity and adventure in their dining experiences, consumers are fostering a culinary revolution that not only celebrates global diversity but also encourages food and beverage creators to explore new frontiers in flavour profiles.\\n\\n\\nUren Food Ingredients has forecasted that \\n will be a major influence throughout the upcoming year, with a specific focus on flavours and ingredients from Africa, South America and the Middle East.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“We expect consumer demand for adventurous global fusion cuisine to continue. Consumers are always on the lookout for unique and exotic flavours from different cultures, making it a great opportunity for chefs and food manufacturers to get creative with their menus,” Uren revealed in a report.\\n\\n\\nOn this topic, Mecca Ibrahim, Co-Founder of Women in the Food Industry and \\n Advisory Board member shone a spotlight on Korean and South East Asian late-night foods, predicting that they will be “bigger than ever” this year.\\n\\n\\n“We have already seen the massive rise in food and experiences inspired by K-Pop and K-Dramas such as Squid Game. The West End is already showing signs of late-night food not being based around falling out of a night-club and then eating a kebab or KFC, but healthier trends of elaborate frozen desserts, teas and varieties of sweetcorn are taking hold.\\n\\n\\n“Flavours from Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, Southeast Asian, Japan and the Philippines show no sign of abating and I think that Korean Gochujang will become as ubiquitous as Sriracha was in its day and may even be seen in takeaways alongside brown sauce, mayo and vinegar.”\\n\\n\\nThis year beckons food enterprises to not just tap into but embrace the flavours and authenticity of various cultures, perhaps redefining menus and product lines.\\n\\n\\nAI fuelled food safety\\n\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) has been a hot topic for a while now. Widely discussed at \\nFood Integrity Global conference, experts gathered to determine just how this powerful tool can be used to strengthen food safety. In fact, Crew told New Food that he believes it could “play a major role in helping to reduce world hunger”.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut how is it useful? The application of AI can be extended across the entire food supply chain, leveraging predictive analytics, machine learning, and real-time monitoring to enhance safety protocols. It can also be adopted by large and small scale manufacturing businesses to identify risks, facilitate swift intervention and prevent contamination or outbreaks.\\n\\n\\nWhen asked how he think AI could transform the sector in 2024, Crew shared: “I think that we are all still coming to terms with the potential impact of AI. I personally believe that we are going through the fourth industrial revolution. I believe it will enable us to deliver an even higher level of food safety.\\n\\n\\n“By using AI and optical imaging we could quickly and accurately identify pathogens in food, helping to prevent foodborne outbreaks and illnesses. AI will enable us to become more aware of food safety risks in our manufacturing environments and be able to pinpoint corrective actions. It will help us improve crop yields, quality, nutrition and traceability while decreasing resource consumption and hopefully help to eliminate food waste.”\\n\\n\\nHowever this emerging technology doesn’t come without its concerns, with Crew noting that it will “undoubtedly” replace a number of food sector technical jobs.\\n\\n\\nLess ultra-processed\\n\\n\\nBack in October 2022, the UK Government introduced a \\n on the promotion of high in fat, salt or sugar (HFSS) products, something that caused quite a \\n in the sector.\\n\\n\\nThough the restriction of HFSS products by location came into force on 1 October 2022, restriction by volume price will be activated on 1 October 2025. But where does that leave us in 2024?\\n\\n\\nAs part of its trends report, Mintel claimed that “clear communication will become necessary to help consumers make informed decisions about how processed and ultra-processed food and drink fit into their diets”. With this in mind, manufacturers and retailers appear to be actively reevaluating their product portfolios and marketing strategies, with an increased focus on reformulating existing products to reduce HFSS content.\\n\\n\\nIn fact, CEO of Produced in Kent, Floortje Hoette, has noticed that there has been some “really innovative independent businesses using ingredients, where quality takes precedence and processing is considered to ensure maximum taste and minimum additives.”\\n\\n\\nCould the increasing awareness of the health implications associated with ultra-processed foods be driving a shift toward favouring whole, natural ingredients? Only the next 12 months will tell.\\n\\n\\nLocalised food solutions\\n\\n\\nThough the Food and Drink Federation (FDF) reported that food exports during the first half of 2023 rose to almost \\n, at the end of last year, the World Bank observed that, as of December 11, 2023, 19 countries had implemented 27 \\n.\\n\\n\\nWith cases of extreme weather impacting farming across the globe, including the \\n, the interconnectedness of global food trade has witnessed a shift and forced the sector to re-evaluate trade between countries.\\n\\n\\nSpeaking on our “Food to Go” podcast, Professor Chris Elliott warned the industry that, due to the “ongoing impact of a climate crisis, we have to expect more and more food shortages.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“The fresh produce supply chains are already very stretched. We’ve had massive climate problems happening in different parts of the world where we source a lot of our food stuffs from. I think more empty supermarket shelfs for longer is my prediction for this year,” continued Elliott.\\n\\n\\nSo how should the food and beverage sector respond to this concerning prediction? Well, according to Elliott, 2024 is a key year to consider deglobalisation “looking after your own population, and making sure they are fed properly”.\\n\\n\\nWith the Environment Secretary, Steve Barclay, recently announcing plans to back British farmers by utilising \\n for British food produce, including the use of a UK GI logo on food packaging, the urgency for consumers to support farmer’s close to home is evident.\\n\\n\\nThe food sector is no stranger to adaptation. We witnessed first-hand just how agile it can be during difficult periods such as the COVID-19 pandemic. With climate change being a concern worldwide, the urgency for consumers to support farmers close to home becomes increasingly apparent, signalling a potential shift towards more in-country food consumption in 2024.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "               'text': '\\n\\nTurning up the dial on frozen\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), the food system contributes a third of global greenhouse gas emissions. We know that failure to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change not only threatens lives and livelihoods across the world but could materially impact many businesses. Therefore, every food business must play its part in reducing greenhouse gas emissions across the value chain.\\n\\n\\nFrozen food may not be front of mind for most people when they think about how to reduce their carbon footprint and so as Europe’s leader in frozen food we are on a mission to make sure the benefits of frozen are better understood – at the same time as we continue to put nutritious, tasty, affordable and responsibly produced food on consumer tables and find ways to manage our business and our supply chain more efficiently. \\xa0\\n\\n\\nFrozen in time\\xa0\\n\\n\\nIn 2024, we will celebrate the centenary of one the most crucial inventions that’s shaped food manufacturing for generations: the flash-freezing process. Clarence Birdseye revolutionised the method of freezing fresh fish in 1924 and to this day, the same method of preserving the freshness of fish, meat and vegetables without compromising on its quality, nutritional value and taste has been used by the global food manufacturing industry.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere is another area in frozen food, which has also remained unaltered for generations: the assumed temperature at which we store our frozen food products – from wholesaler to retailer – and at home too!\\u202fWhy has this not changed we wondered – and could making even a small change to the temperature that we store frozen food be a way to make a huge reduction in energy use! \\xa0\\n\\n\\nBuilding on Clarence’s legacy of innovation\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\nGiven our position as Europe’s leading frozen food company and the proud owner of the Birds Eye brand in key markets including the UK, Nomad Foods\\xa0decided to launch a breakthrough project aimed at exploring whether temperatures above –18C / 0F (the industry standard) can be targeted to store frozen food, without any negative implications on the quality or safety of products.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWorking with leading global external research partner, Campden BRI, we commissioned a\\xa0pilot study, focusing on nine savoury products from across the Nomad Foods portfolio including poultry, natural fish, coated fish, vegetables, plant-based products from the ‘Green Cuisine’ range and pizza. The eight areas for analysis were microbiological, texture, oxidative rancidity, drip loss, nutrition, energy use and packaging. The temperatures used for testing were -18, -15, -12 and -9 centigrade.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nIn terms of scale, we believe this to be a ‘first of its kind’ study, given the data for this kind of research doesn’t currently exist anywhere else.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nOur study also follows the industry leading research we previously announced in 2022, focused on the \\n of frozen food, which showed that category performs very well against alternative preservation methods in terms of carbon footprint, partly due to much lower levels of food waste.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWhat the results tell us \\u202f\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe initial six-month pilot study in 2023 showed encouraging results against all the test criteria. All products remained micro-safe, there were no signs of oxidative rancidity, minor change in texture (Mixed Veg on -9oC, and Salmon Filets at -12oC.) and most crucially for today’s debate, it showed that for every 3oC increase in temperature there was a drop of 10-11 percent in energy consumption.\\u202f\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSpeaking about the results of the first six month pilot, our CEO, Stefan Descheemaeker, says: “This new pilot study with Campden BRI shows that we have the potential to significantly reduce energy use when storing frozen products, without reformulating. Delivered at scale, this could revolutionise our industry and deliver substantial energy use and cost reductions for manufacturers, food retailers and consumers and further reduce the carbon footprint of frozen food products.”\\xa0\\n\\n\\nEmma Hanby, Associate Director at Campden BRI has said: “We have shown that an increase in freezer temperatures to -15 degrees C (from the industry standard of -18 degrees C) reduces energy consumption without any decrease in product safety or quality.”\\xa0\\n\\n\\nSo, what’s next?\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWe anticipate announcing the twelve month results early in 2024 and should they be as promising for longer term freezing as the initial six month study, then there will be a huge incentive – if not necessity – for the industry as a whole to be galvanised into action.\\u202f\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWe’re already encouraged to see many business partners and external stakeholders recognising the importance of this issue publicly. For example, the British Frozen Food Federation (BFFF), the UK’s frozen food trade association, with over 200 members comprising producers, wholesalers, importers, exporters, brokers, retailers and related associate businesses. Its CEO, Rupert Ashby, says: “The industry has a duty to look at how it can be sustainable and efficient. Increasing freezer temperatures is one area that could be a potential answer”, before adding “there will need to be collaboration not just in the UK but worldwide and there will need to be changes in legislation and how it impacts different foods.”\\xa0\\n\\n\\nIndustry-wide collaboration is essential to this venture truly succeeding. Whilst Nomad Foods, with our diverse portfolio of products, broad supply chain, and operations across multiple European markets, is in a key position to drive change, we recognise we cannot do this alone. \\xa0\\n\\n\\nClarence Birdseye led the way 100 years ago. Our hope is that we can come together as an industry to build on his legacy and transform the next 100 years and beyond for the benefit of our consumers, our communities and our planet? We know this will be challenging but we are excited about the potential for change and the opportunity we have to work with and learn from other businesses and key stakeholders. \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Not only did food, agriculture and water have a dedicated thematic day and several pavilions, but the summit opened with more than 130 countries signing up to the \\n on Sustainable Agriculture, Resilient Food Systems and Climate Action.\\n\\n\\nThe linkages between global food systems and climate change are becoming increasingly clear and urgent. Mounting evidence shows that the way countries produce, consume and dispose of food generates around a \\n of the greenhouse gas emissions that are driving up global temperatures. But more and more countries, especially those in the Global South, are also facing the reality that higher temperatures, erratic rainfall and climate extremes are in turn making farming increasingly difficult, threatening food security and livelihoods.\\n\\n\\nGovernments therefore face the challenge of needing to rapidly reduce agricultural emissions while at the same time, ensuring that farmers can produce enough healthy, safe and affordable food to meet growing demand.\\n\\n\\nAnimal agriculture plays a particularly significant role in the race to climate-resilient food systems. Globally, the livestock sector is estimated to be responsible for \\n of direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions, 44 per cent of which are methane. But in regions such as Africa, livestock and animal-source foods have a lower environmental footprint and offer vital climate resilience to heat, drought and climate shocks, while also reducing nutrient deficiencies and rural poverty.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter a slew of side events, panel discussions and sessions, it is clear that the climate debate must carefully nuance its position on animal agriculture to ensure that the vital benefits it offers, especially to developing countries, are not compromised in the race to Net Zero.\\n\\n\\nFood choice is a privilege\\n\\n\\nWhen it comes to production, consumption, nutrition and health, one thing is clear: the Global North and Global South food systems need climate funding for different solutions. This was the takeaway from The Great Food Debate: Let Them Talk, convened by the International Livestock Research Institute and ProVeg.\\n\\n\\nActions towards developing more sustainable food systems must not leave behind the most vulnerable consumers. Climate action must therefore consider social justice. This includes children in the Global North who are being presented with unhealthy, processed foods as well as those in the Global South who are unable to access a balanced diet.\\n\\n\\nReducing the overconsumption of meat in developed countries would both improve diets and reduce agricultural emissions. But in Africa, pastoralists play a vital role, producing \\n the continent’s meat and milk, a daily glass of which helps children develop both physically and cognitively.\\n\\n\\nClimate finance and policies must therefore take into account how best to support these different outcomes, from shifting diets in high-income countries to enabling pastoralists to adapt to climate change with innovations like index-based insurance and improved livestock feed.\\n\\n\\nClimate winners and losers\\n\\n\\nWithin the question of climate justice is the question of dietary justice, and this raises the issue of power and voice.\\n\\n\\nIn a session on achieving climate and nutrition goals through animal agriculture, Vivian Maduekeh from the Global Alliance of the Future of Food outlined six guiding principles to consider when debating the merits of plant-based diets versus animal-source foods. These included:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPutting farmers first\\n\\n\\nDiscussions about transforming food systems for a climate crisis often omit those on the frontline. Farmers are responsible for implementing the practical changes discussed at events like COP28 that will improve the sustainability of agriculture.\\n\\n\\nBut farmers are also contending with evolving and increasingly unpredictable conditions, especially those in regions hardest hit by climate change. More than \\n have died during the ongoing and unprecedented drought across the Horn of Africa. It can take \\n for farmers to recover from these losses if at all, according to UN reports.\\n\\n\\nA session on putting farmers first highlighted how existing adaptation efforts and support fall short. With escalating climate risks, urgent action is needed to expedite financing and implement climate change actions in agri-food and livestock systems, both to reduce emissions and ensure food and nutrition security.\\n\\n\\nThe voice of Africa: a new narrative for livestock on the continent\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe conversation around livestock systems remains polarized and lacks nuance. This is particularly true when talking about livestock systems in Africa. Livestock production plays a critical role in livelihoods, nutrition and climate adaptation across diverse production systems in Africa, and has the potential to contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and Africa’s Agenda 2063 Developmental Goals. This is quite different from how livestock systems are perceived and managed in the Global North.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe prevailing “meat and milk are bad” narrative frequently lumps livestock farmers in the developing world – most of whom practice low-input systems of production – with industrial and highly intensive farming systems in the\\xa0 Global North.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe session on Creating a New Livestock Narrative for Africa: the Role of Resilience in Livestock Systems highlighted the critical role of livestock in Africa’s livelihoods, nutrition, and its capacity for climate change adaptation. It described how sustainable livestock production practices can assist African countries in achieving their developmental goals while adhering to environmental limits.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nGeorge Wamukoya, Director of the African Groups of Negotiators Expert Support (AGNES), outlined how this narrative has muddled negotiators’ ability to talk about livestock in Africa. “In the negotiations,\\xa0it became\\xa0clear that many don;t understand livestock in Africa,” he said.\\xa0“In Africa, livestock is\\xa0tied to livelihood, culture and many things.”\\n\\n\\nOne message was clear above all others at the climate talks: the challenges of food security and climate change are inextricably linked. The world cannot rein in climate change without transforming food systems, but in doing so, governments must also safeguard food, nutrition and economic security for farmers and consumers around the world. Solving this dilemma is essential to the future of the planet and the entire population.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Historically in San Francisco, the Cultured Meat Symposium is an annual gathering of industry leaders that discuss the future of cell-cultured meat and seafood technologies.\\n\\n\\nThis year’s theme was product development and manufacturing. Topics included process improvements, commercial scalability, hybrid products, AI automation, fundraising, government regulations, and my favourite, “Culinary Innovation: Exploring Cultured Meat with a Chef,” the title of my keynote presentation that started the second day of CMS23.\\n\\n\\nIn this article I will be sharing my key takeaways and examples of long-term strategies that excite the food industry.\\n\\n\\nChefs are first-to-market trend setters\\n\\n\\nMore than simply what is trending, chefs are innovators who speak on the plate and continuously think about what is next. Often chefs have thought of how to make an innovative ingredient or sustainable product taste great before anyone else. One example is ten years ago a 3-Michelin star restaurant called Manresa in Los Gatos, California served a cauliflower risotto.\\n\\n\\nShortly thereafter, cauliflower started to appear on the center of the plates across several fine-dining restaurants. Now the cauliflower trend has scaled to what seems to be every aisle of the grocery store—from rice to pizza to buffalo wings, among other categories. We also saw this with other vegetables like kale.\\n\\n\\nMore recently, David Chang put the Impossible burger on his single-restaurant menu in 2016. Now the Impossible meat is in over 45,000 locations globally.\\n\\n\\nConsumers trust chefs, and that can support cultured meat companies\\n\\n\\nSince chefs have been setting the trends before mass consumer adoption, chefs are data points before any quantitative data exists. They sit in the middle of our giant food system as thought leaders and translators people trust.\\n\\n\\nAccordingly, chefs are the people who have power over our food system and can shape not only how we eat, but also our climate future. Many even have access to their city officials and policymakers who dine at their restaurants—which can be an important regulatory asset.\\n\\n\\nEqually, cultured meat companies can support chefs\\n\\n\\nChefs have a powerful voice that inspires consumer habits, but there is only so much chefs (or anyone) can do on a restaurant plate each night.\\n\\n\\nRight now chefs want to figure out how to have an impact beyond the traditional “back-of-the-house” kitchen; and right now we need leaders in to culinary industry to step up to do more than plate a small number of dishes each service. Serving a unique, cultured meat product can increase foot traffic, visibility, position chefs as a trend setting sustainability thought leader, and provide multiple business lines for restaurants. This is especially relevant now as restaurants all over are closing—including David Chang’s Two Michelin star Momofuku Ko.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOffering cultured meat can broaden or even better engage high-end clientele to a restaurant community for their next luxury dining experience. One example I gave was having a “bites” menu section that would increase check averages. Another example is to start with a limited time offer. Cultured meat companies can then have a marketing campaign that adds customers and proves serving cultured meat is a strong value proposition that increases revenue. Even if not with a Michelin star chef, building a playbook with lower stake chef-partners will make launching future partnerships more successful.\\n\\n\\nAs CMS23 guest Kaitlin Grady, Director of Strategic Partnerships and Public Affairs, Clever Carnivore, Inc, Shared: “Chef engagement has been top of mind for Clever Carnivore as we develop our prototype products, and Philip’s presentation provided practical tools for fostering this crucial partnership. This takeaway especially resonated: “Chefs are uniquely positioned to share what matters and why.”\\n\\n\\nCo-innovation partnership\\n\\n\\nChefs and cultured meat companies can form co-innovation partnerships that enable a more rapid and successful market entry. Cultured meat companies can hire chefs as an “R&D Culinary Consultant” to test their product on restaurant menus for live feedback, and chefs can continuously improve the product from there. Restaurants can be a consumer testing ground, a real-world sensory panel. This is especially valuable for restaurants if they conducted this as a ticketed event on their slowest business days of the week. Long-term, this early R&D could lead to a smoother commercialisation path and more refined product, be it better in taste, new SKUs, different flavors, form factors, or cost effectiveness.\\n\\n\\nOne of the CMS23 producers summarised: “Philip’s presentation at the Cultured Meat Symposium was eye-opening to many in the cultivated meat industry,” said Anita Broellochs, Producer at SVCMS and Founder of Balletic Foods.\\n\\n\\n“Considering every company will have to go to market initially with a blended product, Philip highlighted how chefs can be involved from the very start ensuring the end product is something that consumers will seek out, whether that’s because of taste, accessibility, nutritional value, or presentation of the product. It was truly inspiring to hear thoughts from a chef firsthand and learn how companies can get started in collaborating with a chef.”\\n\\n\\nCulinary directions\\xa0\\n\\n\\nChefs need creative freedom with cultured meat. One of the CMS23 topics was that companies will have to enter the market with hybrid end products that use their cultured meat as an ingredient in a total formulation. This is an exciting opportunity for chefs who love innovation. They could add miso, caramelised onions, and black garlic to cultured beef, stuff charcoal-smoked garlic rice into cultured chicken wrapped in crispy yuba skin, or add roasted porcini mushrooms to cultured seafood, as examples.\\n\\n\\nIn addition to blended products, there are four culinary directions for chefs:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChefs as innovators, advocates and trendsetters\\n\\n\\nChefs are major stakeholders in the future of food and will be a key ingredient in making cultured meat and seafood a craveable eating experience for consumers. To quote one chef attendee:\\n\\n\\n“As a chef, my main take away from CMS23 is the need for collaborative innovation between scientists and chefs. While the replication of farm-raised meat taste and texture is vital, these principles will come in time as cultured meat is more readily available. The more that cultured meat companies realize the role chefs play as trusted translators of culinary arts and science, the more culturally acceptable cultured meat will become,” said Kevin Markey, Ph.D Candidate and Teaching Assistant, Foods Lab Department of Nutrition & Food Science, and Synergy Grant, Engineered Biomaterials Research Lab, University of Vermont\\n\\n\\nWhat if cultured meat was the new cauliflower? Could Las Vegas be a hot spot for consumers looking for unique experiences that include cultured meat tastings?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "               'text': '\\n\\nWill AI enhance or disrupt the fast food industry?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the world quickly shifts toward an AI-first framework, the food and beverage industry is embracing cutting-edge technologies like conversational AI (CAI) and generative AI (GAI) to reshape the future of food services. According to the \\n, 58 percent of restaurant operators are pinning hopes on the technology to help alleviate labor shortages this year.\\n\\n\\nMajor fast food chains nationwide are launching AI deployments across select locations to help automate customer service and reduce the reliance on human labor. Chains like Popeyes, Panera Bread, Taco Bell, and more are testing CAI and GAI at the drive-thru to help automate and streamline ordering. However, the successful scaling of these initiatives hinges on their effectiveness. There have been instances of fast food chains introducing automated drive-thru order-taking that unintentionally frustrated customers due to inaccuracies and repetitive use of upselling.\\n\\n\\nIn the food business, the customer experience carries great significance. This is especially true for drive-thru and off-premise dining, where the customer’s objective is to get in and out quickly, with exactly what they ordered. When AI drive-thru virtual assistants get their order wrong, or attempt to upsell too frequently, customers are likely to leave dissatisfied.\\n\\n\\nAI, when implemented properly and intelligently, can greatly assist restaurant operations. Below are four main areas where the food service industry can utilise CAI and GAI solutions:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile these use cases are promising, food chains need to consider the following for AI to truly enhance the overall customer experience:\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAI should be conversational, not scripted\\n\\n\\nHumans are comfortable with natural language, so for AI implementations to be effective in food service, they must be genuinely conversational. Legacy chatbot systems may have limitations that often follow hard coded, scripted conversation. They may be incapable of handling complex customer orders and delivering accurate responses in real-time, which defeats the purpose of ‘fast food’.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor example, in a drive-thru ordering scenario, the customer may interrupt the AI virtual assistant to ask a question about adding an ingredient, change the order or ask about promotions. The virtual assistant must be ready and able to properly pivot and maintain the context of the conversation – if it is unable to handle interruptions from customers, it has not been integrated effectively. Simply put, if the AI can’t handle an interruption or answer a question, it’s not so intelligent.\\n\\n\\nHyperpersonalisation is key\\n\\n\\nAI in food service should be capable of emulating human responses with empathy and context-awareness. It is important for it to automatically adapt its vocabulary and language to match the user demographics, and respond to changes in customer voice tone, facial expressions, sentiments, and body language. This ability enables the AI to create tailored interactions, offering personalised menus, services, and solutions based on the users’ unique voice traits, sentiment and patterns.\\n\\n\\nMachine Learning (ML) plays a crucial role here, using special algorithms, features, and datasets that continually learn and adapt through experience. As they receive more input data, CAI and GAI systems improve their pattern recognition abilities, utilising this knowledge to make predictions and deliver more accurate outcomes in quick timeframes.\\n\\n\\nThere is a time and a place for upselling\\n\\n\\nThere are many challenges and nuances of upselling in any sales environment. In the context of AI-driven interactions in the food industry, the drive-thru is a place for convenience and timely service. While upselling may be good for the business’ bottom line, ill-timed offers from a worker or an AI agent can result in customer dissatisfaction.\\n\\n\\nFor upselling to be effective, virtual assistants need to exhibit human-like intelligence to make informed decisions about when to upsell. For example, if a customer orders a fish sandwich, and the AI asks if they’d like to upgrade to a meal, and the customer replies ‘yes,’ the customer is now already aware that they can upgrade to a meal. In this case, an intelligent, nuanced decision would be to not upsell the next item.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen done right, consistent and nuanced upselling is an advantage of AI over human workers. The overall goal is to avoid robotic, repetitive upselling approaches and instead offer a more personalised and effective strategy.\\n\\n\\nProper CAI solutions will revolutionise the food industry\\n\\n\\nFrom self-service kiosks to drive-thru automation and customer service support, there is immense potential for conversational and generative AI solutions in the foodservice industry. However, its success hinges on its ability to engage in genuinely conversational interactions, offer tailored services and implement personalised and effective upselling strategies.\\n\\n\\nWhen the proper AI solutions are implemented, they can revolutionise the foodservice industry, streamlining operations and improving customer satisfaction and loyalty.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Despite being one of Europe’s top consumers of ultra-processed foods (UPFs), with \\n from this category, consumer attitudes are changing.\\n\\n\\nRecent reports, such as Mintel’s \\n, point to a growing tide of concern and a shift towards healthier options. As Mintel’s Director Alex Beckett notes, “Our research reveals a clear trend: 70 percent of UK adults actively try to avoid UPFs.”\\n\\n\\nThis shift does not, however, come without challenges. Consumer confusion reigns supreme: many struggle to identify UPFs lurking in their everyday diets. Surveys highlight this dilemma, with a YouGov study commissioned by the\\n showing that while awareness of UPFs has increased (46 percent vs 30 percent in 2021), so has the difficulty in pinpointing them (61 percent agree clear labelling would be helpful).\\n\\n\\nThe growing concern over UPFs presents both a challenge and an opportunity for the food industry. While confusion may cloud the path for some consumers, the underlying message is clear: customers prioritise healthier, less processed options, and prefer making informed food choices.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWhat exactly are ultra-processed foods?\\n\\n\\nThe term broadly refers to foods that have five or more ingredients and include additives not typically used in home cooking. These additives include preservatives, emulsifiers, sweeteners, and artificial colours and flavours.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\nExamples of ultra-processed foods that you might find on the shelves of your local supermarket include ice cream, sausages, crisps, flavoured yoghurts, mass-produced bread, biscuits, and fizzy drinks. Some alcoholic drinks, including whisky, gin, and rum, may also fall into the ultra-processed category.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA growing body of evidence shows that the increased consumption of these kinds of foods has \\n in the obesity epidemic that plagues the world. That’s because they tend to be higher in calories and lower in nutrition than their processed or unprocessed equivalents. There are \\n associated with these kinds of foods too, including cancer, heart disease, and depression.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe top five foods that people thought were classed as ultra-processed from a list in the recent BNF survey were:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, fewer people classified baked beans (9 percent), low-fat fruit yoghurts (10 percent), ice cream (14 percent), and sliced bread (19 percent) as ultra-processed.\\n\\n\\nIt’s understandable why people eat ultra-processed foods. They’re frequently cheaper and more convenient than their unprocessed and processed counterparts and have long shelf lives, making them feel even more cost effective. But we are seeing a growing desire for customers to reduce their consumption of UPFs or avoid them altogether, instead pursuing healthier alternatives, so how should the industry respond to this consumer confusion?\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nEmbracing transparency and catering to healthier options\\n\\n\\nConsumer priorities are shifting. Transparency and health are rising to the top of the food agenda. The industry must adapt to thrive and ensure consumers get quality products. Gone are the days of opaque ingredient lists and sugar-laden enticements. Clear and accessible labelling and nutrient-rich options are now the keys to building trust and addressing consumer confusion.\\n\\n\\nThis doesn’t mean abandoning convenience but expanding offerings to include minimally processed choices that align with evolving preferences. Beyond this, there needs to be a wider push for promoting nutritionally complete, whole foods to address consumer confusion and the growing demand for healthier choices.\\n\\n\\nConsumers shouldn’t have to sacrifice convenience, scouring every label or hunting down specialist retailers to make these changes either. It’s something we firmly believe at \\n. That’s why we stock more than 4,000 healthy groceries for all diets and lifestyles and we also have a wide variety of resources aimed at helping people find the ingredients most beneficial to the lifestyle they want to lead.\\n\\n\\nThe food industry’s future hinges on its ability to adapt to the evolving consumer attitudes towards ultra-processed foods and the desire to see more nutritionally complete foods on shelves. By prioritising transparency, diversifying offerings and investing in healthier options, the industry can satisfy consumer needs for better communicated and healthier, more accessible food choices.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "               'text': '\\n\\nStepping up to the plate: Nick Stevens\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe coffee sector is booming. In fact, Statista predicts that the coffee market worldwide is projected to grow by \\n between 2024 and 2028.\\n\\n\\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of the coffee sector, leadership and innovation crucial roles in shaping the industry’s future. Nick Stevens, the newly appointed B2B Commercial Director for Nespresso Professional in the UK and Republic of Ireland, sits down with New Food to discuss his seven years worth of experience within the company, delving into his background, insights and vision for Nespresso Professional.\\n\\n\\nWho are you and what is your new role?\\n\\n\\nNick Stevens, I’m the newly appointed B2B Commercial Director for Nespresso Professional in the UK and Republic of Ireland (ROI).\\n\\n\\nWhat experience do you have in the sector?\\n\\n\\nI have been at Nespresso Professional for nearly seven years – I love this team and I’m excited for the new challenge. I am looking forward to this fun and new chapter growing the B2B division across various commercial areas including HORECA and Office commerce. I moved to Nespresso in 2017 from Nestle Waters where I held responsibility for the HORECA channel, where I worked for over three years. Prior to this, I worked in the hotel industry as a director in sales and marketing, where I was responsible across revenue, marketing, and partnership sectors of the businesses. My previous experience also includes time at the Morgans Hotel Group and The May Fair Hotel.\\n\\n\\nAfter nearly seven years at Nespresso, what have you learnt about the coffee sector?\\n\\n\\nThe coffee sector is always changing and advancing. For businesses looking to keep their employees and their customers happy, good coffee is no longer just a ‘nice to have’. Our sustainability journey is decades old at Nespresso, but everyone is now more conscious of the urgent need to act to protect our planet. Whether you are managing a FTSE 100 office, an independent retail business, a golf club or an international hotel, every business is under pressure to act more sustainably – whilst maintaining standards.\\n\\n\\nWhat is something that Nespresso Professional is working on right now that really excites you?\\n\\n\\nAt Nespresso Professional we are currently working on the new launch of our Brazil Organic coffee to add to our Origins range. The capsule will join the collection which has flavours from Peru, Congo, and Colombia. All the coffees in this range are ‘Made with Care’ and sourced from carefully selected regions in each of these countries.\\n\\n\\nWe are also exploring new partnerships and products. I can’t share much right now, but there are lots of exciting things coming down the track this year – new blends, new recipes, new innovations. The expansion of our Professional range and presence is something really important to me and my team.\\n\\n\\nTell me one recent news story that has stood out to you in recent months concerning food and beverage and why?\\n\\n\\nOne story that has really stood out to me was a programme that asked, “\\n ‘Third spaces’ are communal, socialising places like coffee shops and the benefits they can bring to communities and individuals is fascinating.\\n\\n\\nNespresso Professional recently did some research into why office workers are adopting a ‘work from anywhere’ approach; opting to work from cafés, libraries, hotels, or even bars! We discovered that people find these environments inspiring and productive.\\n\\n\\nI personally love spending time at the office with my team – it is invaluable. If you are someone with the opportunity to work flexibly, though, why not pop into a local venue and grab a sandwich or a coffee whilst you work? That support could make all the difference and many in the HORECA industry are already starting to create bespoke offerings.\\n\\n\\nWhat are your visions for your new role at the time of stepping up?\\n\\n\\nWhere to start? As someone that has come up through the industry and been at Nespresso for years, I never want to lose sight of how important our customer experience is. I love getting out and meeting our partners; learning what makes them tick. I’m quite straight-talking and the people side of the business is something I am passionate about. Hopefully that openness and my genuine passion for this team and this business will shine through.\\n\\n\\nAt the same time, I am focused on spotting new opportunities – we can tailor our offering to businesses of any size, in any sector, and that is exciting as we expand. There are lots of innovations in the pipeline that I can’t wait to bring to life.\\n\\n\\nHow to do see the coffee sector evolving in the next three years?\\n\\n\\nA great question! I’m optimistic about coffee as a force for good. I think we’ll see new innovations that reduce the sector’s negative impact on the environment and a concerted effort across the board to move towards regenerative and socially responsible practices.\\n\\n\\nThe creativity that people apply to their coffee isn’t going away. It’s hard to believe that pumpkin spice or Matcha were once unusual here in the UK, but they were! We’re seeing new blends that bring surprising flavour combinations to the fore and I can’t wait to see what’s next.\\n\\n\\nWhat is one trend you believe will take the sector by storm in 2024?\\n\\n\\nOur understanding of the health and wellbeing benefits of coffee is improving every year. The ties between wellness and coffee will only strengthen further – and that’s an opportunity for the sector.\\n\\n\\nWe are already seeing some combine ingredients like mushrooms, protein, and collagen with their coffees. At Nespresso, we recently launched Ginseng Delight and Vivida B12 for consumers to enjoy at home. But we’re only at the tip of the iceberg when it comes to this trend – watch this space because wellness is certainly going to take the sector by storm!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Brands began to experiment with new flavour combinations and premium ingredients, challenging the notion that canned beverages were inferior or weaker than\\xa0 their freshly-made counterparts. As a result, consumers became more open to trying canned cocktails as a convenient and enjoyable alternative to traditional mixed drinks.\\n\\n\\nThe rise of social media and digital platforms helped to fuel interest in canned cocktails, with brands leveraging these channels to showcase their products, engage with consumers and collaborate with other brands in a more accessible way than ever. The visual appeal of canned cocktails, combined with their convenience and portability, made them a popular choice for social gatherings and outdoor events and festivals.\\n\\n\\nThe canned cocktail revolution can be seen as a natural evolution of consumer preferences towards convenience, quality, and sustainability. As consumers continue to seek out convenient and innovative beverage options, the market for canned cocktails is likely to continue its growth trajectory, offering consumers a diverse array of premium, ready-to-drink options to enjoy on any occasion.\\n\\n\\nCreating in a crowded market\\n\\n\\nAt Pimentae, we recognised this burgeoning trend early on and seized the opportunity to innovate within the space. Our ‘Pocket of Paradise’ collection, featuring cocktails like the Spicy Margarita, Tommy’s Margarita and Cucumber Margarita, embodies our commitment to crafting cocktails that offer quality, captivate the senses and provide the convenience consumers crave.\\n\\n\\nBehind the scenes, the innovation process is a collaborative effort that spans flavour development, ingredient sourcing, and packaging design. Drawing on our expertise and industry insights, we curate each element to ensure it resonates with consumer preferences and stands out in a crowded market. From the selection of premium spirits to the incorporation of natural flavourings and botanicals, every decision is guided by our dedication to quality and authenticity.\\n\\n\\nAs consumer palates become more discerning, there is a growing appetite for unique and more sophisticated flavours in cocktails. This presents an opportunity for brands like Pimentae to experiment with bold flavours and redefine the boundaries of traditional cocktail offerings. Our bestselling Spicy Margarita is the prime example of this. Crafting the perfect chilli extract that offered a delicate balance – delivering depth of flavour with just the right amount of heat, without overpowering the palate. Incorporating a blend of Jalapeno and Scotch Bonnet extracts, this cocktail has garnered widespread acclaim, even among those who typically say they dislike spice.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn an age where Instagram-worthy moments reign supreme, consumers are constantly on the lookout for products that not only taste good but also look aesthetically pleasing. Canned cocktails, with their sleek packaging and vibrant branding, have become the perfect accessory for social gatherings and virtual happy hours, allowing consumers to elevate their drinking experiences while sharing them with friends and followers online. Pimentae’s can range is wrapped in bespoke, hand-painted artwork that tells the story of the brand and the cocktails, consumers want more than just a cocktail, they want experience, feeling and brands that align to their values.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n“A cultural shift towards experimental consumption”\\n\\n\\nIt’s also worth recognising the broader industry trends that have contributed to this phenomenon. Over the past five years, we’ve witnessed a cultural shift towards experiential consumption, consumers crave experiences that engage their senses and evoke emotion. At Pimentae, we place a strong emphasis on listening to our customers and gathering feedback to ensure that our products resonate with their needs and desires. Whether it’s introducing new flavours, improving packaging design, or enhancing sustainability initiatives, we are committed to continuously innovating and adapting to meet the changing demands of our consumer. By staying attuned to their preferences and values, we can build a stronger community and deliver experiences that exceed their expectations.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the market for canned cocktails continues to evolve, it’s essential for brands to remain agile and responsive to changing consumer preferences. This means not only staying ahead of emerging trends but also fostering meaningful connection through authentic storytelling and community engagement. At Pimentae, we understand the importance of building trust and loyalty among our customers, which is why we place a strong emphasis on transparency, sustainability, and community.

       "               'text': '\\n\\nAI’s potential to enhance food safety practices\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe journey towards integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into food safety practices marks a pivotal evolution in how the food industry manages hygiene and safety protocols. Historically, data on food safety is vast but very fragmented.\\n\\n\\nIt is often collected through traditional methods that create a lag in providing real-time insights that are necessary for proactive decision-making. However, with the steady implementation of digital transformation programmes across the food production sector, the landscape is shifting. With the increasing adoption of innovative hygiene inspection solutions that incorporate immediate data capture at the point of testing, we are starting to see a tangible pathway to access real time analytics to transform food safety culture from reactive to proactive.\\n\\n\\nIn this article, we will explore how technology, and the current trend of AI and machine learning, has the ability to redefine cleanliness standards across food production and retail sectors.\\n\\n\\nTapping into traditional limitations\\n\\n\\nTraditional hygiene testing practices in the food industry, such as microbiological culturing, ATP testing, and chemical indicators, do not typically give immediate results and require specialised equipment or training.\\n\\n\\nIn the scenario of a typical food contamination event, where a batch of products is found to be contaminated with \\n, the discovery triggers a cascade of reactive steps. This can include a public recall of the affected products, extensive media announcements to warn consumers, and a costly shutdown of production lines for deep cleaning and investigation. This approach not only incurs significant financial loss but can also damage a brand’s reputation and impact \\xa0consumer trust.\\n\\n\\nNavigating new horizons\\n\\n\\nBy embracing AI and machine learning to make sense of extensive data sets in food safety, we can now trace contamination sources, predict hygiene failures, and even anticipate disruptions within the supply chain.\\n\\n\\nYet, as we navigate this promising horizon, we encounter the critical need to balance innovation with data sensitivity. To bring stakeholders to the table robust encryption, stringent data access controls, and continuous security monitoring are critical to future success.\\n\\n\\nConnected data is an important step to predictive analytics and our industry must remain unwavering in our commitment to data privacy, regulation compliance, and the ethical use of technology.\\n\\n\\nAnonymous predictive power\\n\\n\\nMuch like the advancements seen in healthcare where AI has been instrumental in advancing treatments and predicting outbreaks, the transformative potential in food safety is underscored by its ability to leverage anonymized data for predictive analytics.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy applying similar principles, AI models in the food industry have the ability to forecast potential contamination and food safety breaches, enabling businesses to shift from a reactive to a proactive stance. By bringing together and analysing comprehensive data sets within one system, AI can detect sporadic contamination patterns and identify contamination harbourage points such as machine seals.\\n\\n\\nGoing further, this predictive insight can then be anonymously shared with the food industry to mitigate the same issue occurring for other businesses. These insights can further be refined by correlating with seasonal changes or shift times as more data is analysed, enabling predictions of specific bacterial presence, such as \\n in winter or \\n in summer.\\n\\n\\nAs AI continues to evolve, its role in enhancing traceability and transparency becomes increasingly critical, offering the ability to quickly trace back sources of contamination, thereby not only safeguarding public health but also protecting brand reputation.\\n\\n\\nOptimising supply chains\\n\\n\\nThe application of AI can also extend beyond prediction by playing a crucial role in optimising the supply chain for enhanced efficiency and safety. Through real-time monitoring and risk assessment, AI technologies offer a panoramic view of the supply chain, identifying bottlenecks and potential contamination sources before they become issues.\\n\\n\\nThis level of traceability and transparency was previously unattainable, marking a significant leap towards ensuring the integrity of food from farm to table. Such advancements not only facilitate quicker responses to contamination events but also contribute to a more sustainable and ethical food production system, reflecting a growing consumer demand for transparency.\\n\\n\\nAddressing the challenges\\n\\n\\nDespite the promising prospects of AI in food safety, there are challenges to its implementation, ranging from data privacy concerns to the need for a robust technological infrastructure. Ethical considerations also loom large, especially regarding how data is collected, shared, and used.\\n\\n\\nHowever, by adopting stringent data privacy standards and focusing on the development of ethical AI, the food industry can navigate these challenges. The establishment of a \\n, as seen in initiatives by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), points towards a collaborative approach in overcoming these obstacles.\\n\\n\\nFurther industry research completed by the European Parliamentary Research Service suggests building a \\n can be key to unlocking its full potential, paving the way for a future where food safety and quality are significantly enhanced through technology.\\n\\n\\nWorkforce and regulation\\n\\n\\nThe successful implementation of AI in food safety will require the industry to communicate and educate the workforce on the approaches and methods involved in utilising AI data, and acting on its recommendations.\\n\\n\\nTo allow the use of AI to expand effectively into the food industry, companies will need to communicate to their staff how to use new AI tools to enhance their day-to-day practises, rather than be seen as a nuisance. AI tools can help to empower staff at every level of a company, with managers being able to rapidly report and monitor sites, as well as sample collectors having the ability to rapidly act on any issues observed from their testing. Behavioural change is challenging, so there is a pressing need to hire professionals with expertise in data analytics, AI programming and system integration who can ensure that new data systems are implemented in a well communicated fashion, and meets all regulatory requirements.\\n\\n\\nOpting for a phased approach\\n\\n\\nRecognising the meticulous nature of the food industry, we believe a measured exploration of the potential benefits of AI can provide a clear route to adoption. A phased approach can enable enterprises to understand the benefits of AI while managing brand and reputational concerns.\\n\\n\\nCentral to this journey is addressing data privacy considerations through solid security measures and ethical data practices, ensuring that the adoption of AI enhances consumer trust rather than undermining it. Additionally, cultivating a skilled workforce adept in AI and data analytics, coupled with navigating regulatory landscapes, will be pivotal in overcoming implementation barriers.\\n\\n\\nThe pathway to adoption\\n\\n\\nLooking ahead, we envision a food industry that not only embraces AI for its operational benefits but also sees it as a catalyst for building a more transparent, safe, and efficient food supply chain. This future is not just about leveraging technology for the sake of innovation but about fostering a human culture of safety and quality that benefits all stakeholders through producers, consumers, and regulators alike. By approaching AI adoption with an open mind and a commitment to collaboration and continuous improvement, we can pave the way for a food industry that is not only more resilient to safety challenges but also more responsive to the evolving demands of a global consumer base.\\n\\n\\nThe more heterogeneous data that can be incorporated into AI models, from a range of sources including all sizes and types of food producers, restaurants and commercial kitchens through to regulators, the sharper an AI model can be in informing the entire food industry in predicting food safety trends and providing the most efficient routes to proactive food safety.\\n\\n\\nEmpowering safety\\n\\n\\nNew technology often fails to roll out when it is poorly understood by the user. AI must be seen and demonstrated to enhance a manager’s work process, empowering a safety auditor in their reporting and aiding a cleaner in proactively responding to a detected risk. When setting out on our mission to make contamination visible through a simple colour change technology test, making hygiene accessible to all levels of the food sector has been a central tenet of our vision. By working with industry partners combining simple and quick hygiene testing with cloud data solutions we firmly believe that AI can be used as a powerful tool to ensure the highest standards of food safety and quality, today and in the years to come.\\n\\n\\nTo find out more about the impact of AI in the food sector, listen to New Food’s two part podcast series on the applications of AI \\n.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "               'text': '\\n\\nPlant based: Finding the recipe for success\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI am a development chef by trade, and I worked for many years developing recipes for large cooking sauce brands. For decades, the biggest selling cooking sauce in the UK was the Homepride tinned Curry Sauce, a product that made the company I worked for a huge amount of money. It was widely seen as old fashioned, inauthentic, cheap and poor quality, but consistently outperformed every other cooking sauce on the market.\\n\\n\\nThe funny thing was, every other Indian cooking sauce brand wanted to think of itself as premium, and all of them ended up fighting over a small segment of the market, offering authentic flavours, premium indulgence, and a restaurant experience at home. Whereas Homepride quietly provided a simple, cheap, family friendly product that people could rely on, and went about its business largely unchallenged by other brands.\\n\\n\\nI saw a similar thing happen during the explosion of vegan meat brands between 2019 and 2021. Dozens of shiny new players, some backed by food giants, others by venture capitalists, all with exciting new products and big marketing spends. And seemingly all of them were fighting at the premium end of the market, looking for a piece of the big spending millennials, interested in ethical consumerism from a funky lifestyle brand.\\n\\n\\nFast forward to 2023 and the on-rushing cost of living crisis was to plough straight into the super-premium plant-based market, leaving casualties strewn all over the tracks. Stretched consumers abandoned plant-based brands at the same time as costs were spiralling, putting many brands and manufacturers out of business. I cannot help thinking that if any of those brands had built themselves around offering consumers value, a cost-of-living crisis would have been their chance to shine. What we needed was a plant-based Homepride. What we got were a dozen wannabe Teslas.\\n\\n\\nOn the surface, there seems to be very little reason why plant-based should not be offering better value than meat. After all, most of the ingredients in plant-based meat products are similar to the constituents of animal feed. Can it really be cheaper and more efficient to feed soya to a pig and make a sausage out of that pig’s meat, than to make a sausage directly out of soya?\\n\\n\\nOur latest \\n set out to explore the reasons behind the price premium that plant-based seems to command and found a complex picture. The issue is not entirely down to the high margin expectations of highly leveraged vegan start-ups. Although soya protein is indeed cheaper than meat, the cost of turning that protein into something delicious and functional is what makes plant-based command a price premium.\\n\\n\\nOur analysis shows that flavours, gelling agents, emulsifiers and colours add considerable costs. And perhaps even more significant, the complexity of plant-based formulations, with so many additional steps and processes, creates huge wastage and inefficiency. Making a beef burger involves little more than mixing some meat with a seasoning pack and forming into shapes, whereas a plant-based equivalent often requires four or five steps, all of which take time and produce waste.\\n\\n\\nAdd to that the low volumes and short chilled shelf lives, and plant-based ends up being far more expensive to get on shelf. These inefficiencies left plant-based producers extremely vulnerable once the cost-of-living crisis started to bite, forcing them to cut already tight margins to chase volume, or have rates of sale drop so low that they risk being delisted. The fact that almost all of the new plant-based meat brands were premium options cannot have helped, as consumers were never likely to shop the fixture in search of value. It was a disaster that could have, and probably should have, been predicted.\\n\\n\\nOf course, the existence of a Homepride for plant-based meat is predicated on it being possible to offer value plant-based burgers and sausages that are high enough in quality. Even at the value end of a market, families demand delicious options and will turn their backs if brands don’t deliver. And although this challenge is difficult, our report shows that it is possible. There are various approaches at the ingredient level that can help manufacturers take significant costs out of formulations.\\n\\n\\nOptimising the use of flavourings is a key approach, as flavour can drive as much as 40 percent of the ingredient cost of many plant-based products. Switching to less processed protein concentrates, rather than expensive protein isolates is another way of taking out considerable cost and will also reduce the carbon impact of recipes. New methods of achieving meat-like structures are increasingly available, many of which are cleaner label and cheaper than conventional methylcellulose-based approaches. And finding ways of optimising the use of side streams from protein extraction is increasingly important, with the potential to dramatically bring down the cost of formulations.\\n\\n\\nPlant-based needs some concerted, incremental product development activity to bring down the cost of recipes, increasing profitability and most importantly, offering consumers some value options. If delicious plant-based burgers and nuggets are available that are comparable in price to meat, or preferably cheaper, then I have no doubt there would be considerable switching. Most consumers buy processed meat products in spite of the fact they are made from animals, not because of it. Provide something better that they can afford, and a lot of the barriers will come down.\\n\\n\\nWhilst many commenters consider the future of plant-based to be about precision fermentation and cellular agriculture, I think what it really needs is some boring, old-fashioned cost reduction. That might not generate as much investment cash as promising lab-grown meat by 2030, but it will probably have a much bigger impact on the food people eat.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "               'text': '\\n\\nHow is ADM moving the needle when it comes to food flavours?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe food flavours sector is one of the biggest in the food and beverage industry, \\n.\\n\\n\\nWith a market of that kind of size and scale, being truly innovative is a huge challenge. Consumers have huge expectations when it comes to flavour, and therefore so do manufacturers and retailers. That pressure travels up the chain and lands with people such as Angela Barnard, Senior Flavourist Citrus, and Sunarie Servais, EMEA Director of Product Marketing, Flavours, both at ADM.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0spoke to Barnard and Servais to understand ADM’s new Corefold™ technology, the changes it has introduced to the flavour sector and the challenges they face in fulfilling often unrealistic demands from their consumers.\\n\\n\\nWhat is ADM’s Corefold™ technology?\\n\\n\\nDriven by demand for unique and differentiated citrus profiles, we have engineered Corefold™ citrus flavour technology to deliver refreshing citrus flavours that are captivating European consumers’ attention. Made possible through novel and proprietary separation technologies and concentration methods, Corefold™ focuses on the core part of citrus, emphasising the molecules responsible for impact and mouthfeel while capturing top notes for freshness and aroma.\\n\\n\\nIdeally suited across a wide range of beverage applications, Corefold™ can solve specific formulation challenges while delivering offerings that burst with crisp citrus flavours. For example, when used in flavoured water formulations, Corefold™ can deliver the needed body and mouthfeel that may be lost without juice or sugar content. Corefold™ also helps ensure citrus notes shine through beer bases, tantalising consumers’ tastebuds.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTaking citrus as an example, how do you create the classic citrus flavour which consumers think of?\\n\\n\\nFormulating authentic citrus flavours and ingredients requires the appropriate process technologies adapted to the desired end application. With our innovative citrus flavour systems and decades of flavour creation expertise, we use a combination of tools and strategies to accentuate the molecules that evoke the fresh citrus notes consumers expect.\\n\\n\\nOur flavourists use raw material strategies and captive technologies to maximise flavour creation flexibility across applications. These raw materials include peel oil, essence oil and water phase, each bringing different flavour characteristics, such as juicy or tangy. Utilising a combination of distillation and non-thermal technologies, such as liquid-liquid chromatography and membrane extraction, we create authentic flavour solutions with superior solubility and stability, including those made with our Corefold™ technology.\\n\\n\\nHow do you translate what consumers say they want into tangible flavours?\\n\\n\\nOur research into citrus flavour preferences helps guide and support our customers in developing exemplary citrus sensory experiences. Of the six European countries – the UK, France, Spain, Italy, Germany, and Poland – we surveyed, most European consumers are drawn to citrus’ bright and uplifting qualities\\n. They also tend to enjoy familiar citrus flavours within the region, such as Sicilian lemon, Valencia orange and ruby red grapefruit1. However, these consumers are also interested in expanding their horizons, with curiosity in trying more exotic varietals, such as yuzu, Tahiti lime or key lime\\n.\\n\\n\\nHaving a deep understanding of where the market is heading and developing a set of tools that can support what’s next is vital. Coupling in-depth regional insights with technologies like Corefold™ can unlock the power of citrus.\\n\\n\\nIs it difficult to bridge what’s possible in terms of technology to what consumers want?\\n\\n\\nOur global team of flavourists and food scientists take a collaborative approach to technical development, enabling us to help our customers deliver the true-to-fruit citrus tastes consumers crave. We collaborate with our customers to ideate and develop solutions and products that can overcome potential formulation hurdles.\\n\\n\\nSpecifically, with our Corefold™ technology, we can address the challenges of demanding product bases. Liqueurs, for instance, tend to have bold, powerful flavor experiences. As such, citrus notes must be strong to bring the zing and fruitiness needed. Another example is with functional beverages, which include isotonic products and energy drinks that have functional ingredients that may impact taste. In these applications, citrus flavors must have the right potency to support a delicious flavor profile, helping to also mask off-notes and support overall mouthfeel.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Even experienced writers rarely produce their best work on the first draft. They revise their work several times before getting their articles out the door. In fact, the best articles you read in prestigious magazines always get some help. Just like a diva looking ravishing on the red carpet after fashion stylists, make-up artists, and hair and nail experts have done their best to prep her, so does an excellent piece of writing benefit from different inputs before being published. The truth is that many famous bloggers and authors research and then write their drafts, but a skilled editor and proofreader always comes behind to wrap up their work and finish the process. Unfortunately, up to recently, most freelance writers couldn’t afford this luxury, and editing gets often overlooked. Hello, AI Writers. Table of Contents AI Writers To The Rescue Today there are AI writers and editing tools to assist you. However, consider how you want to use them to enhance your work. For example, ChatGPT can be used to brainstorm ideas for blog posts, videos, and other content. You can also use ChatGPT to assist with optimizing your content for search engines. A job once done by SEO experts is now available via AI writers. Primarily, you can conduct your topic research via AI writers and identify trends worth writing about and sources you can use to verify your findings. AI writers are not the be-all and end-all so ,you willmustrn how to edit. 4 Editing Tips You Should Use Here are four editing tips that every freelance content writer should know and use. 1. Avoid Empty Filler Words One of the biggest mistakes content writers make is that they pack a lot of information and ideas into one sentence. They use many empty filler words that add no real value to their content. Let’s look at a few sentences to exemplify this problem: “There are many people who misunderstand the words” AS OPPOSED TO “Many people misunderstand the words.” Or “It takes patience to build trust,” AS OPPOSED TO “Trust takes patience.” The words “it” and “there” followed by a form of the verb “to be” are called grammar expletives and they dilute the writing directedness. A good editor cuts the superfluous use of expletives and emphasizes the proper drivers in the sentence. 2. Avoid Weak Verbs Choosing the proper verbs can make your writing clearer, stronger, and more persuasive. A strong verb can paint a vivid picture in your readers’ minds. Consider the following sentence: “She was a fast runner.” That is a good sentence that can project a concrete image in your mind. Now, consider the more descriptive option “She flew like the wind as she speeded down the track.” You can easily imagine her racing, right? Content writers often use the verb “to be” in the first draft. The problem with “to be” verbs is that they can weaken the words that follow. The solution is to replace them with more powerful alternatives. For example, instead of “The weather was beautiful.” use “The sun shone brightly that day.” 3. Avoid Weak Adjectives Similar to verbs, adjectives can drain out the energy from your text. Savvy editors and content creators avoid using words like “very” and “really” before common adjectives. Some examples are: “Really bad” instead of “Excruciating.” “Really good” instead of “Excellent.” Or “Very common” instead of “Ordinary.” Taking “very” and “really” out of the equation is certainly a “great” thing, as is the use of strong alternatives. For example: Use “Thrilled” instead of “Happy.” Use “Filthy” instead of “Dirty.” Use “Delicious” instead of “Tasty.” You should use the most descriptive language to trigger the reader’s senses and help them imagine how things smell, sound, taste, and feel. 4. Know Your Punctuation You can be the best storyteller in the world. If you lack grammar skills, your mistakes will turn readers off. While an auto-correct program can quickly detect typos, more subtle errors can sneak into your text. The sparingly use of the comma is one of the most common punctuation mistakes most freelance content writers make. Here’s an example: “You can neglect editing, and the audience reading your text may not notice, but your ideas will be lost.” In case you didn’t notice, the missing comma between “editing” and “” suggest “means you can neglect the audience reading your text,” which is precisely the opposite of what you should do or intend, for that matter. Of course, if you read it again, you will realize the sentence’s meaning. But, if people need to go back to grasp what you’re saying, your ideas AND your audience will likely be lost. Conclusion Small changes in your writing can fuel enthusiasm and make people devour your post. It’s just a matter of finding the most potent and specific words.

Specifically, it helps you do the following: Identify profitable sales opportunities Store relevant prospect and buyer information Document service problems Oversee marketing campaigns, etc. A CRM helps you harmonize your management tasks for sales, marketing, and customer relationships, so what are some of its features? CRM features include: Contacts, leads, tasks and campaign management Sales data and analytics Dashboards and report generation Sales forecasting Marketing automation Content database Image repository library Mobile CRM, and more Are you using all these features? Plus, there are more tailored features in the industry-specific CRMs. Industry-specific CRM For example, there are automotive industry CRMs customized to meet dealerships’ unique lead management needs. Other industries also have customized CRMs, including: Healthcare Manufacturing eCommerce Legal Accounting Real Estate and more So the next question is – how can you use your CRM to optimize your content marketing campaigns? Optimizing Your Content Marketing Let’s have a look at what to do with a CRM to improve your content marketing success. 1. Refined Buyer Personas To Target Capture, store and organize customer information, i.e. buyer personas within your CRM. Using the data captured in the CRM, you can uncover insights on your customers through their actions and journeys. With this intel, you can create relevant content for your marketing campaigns that target specific customer demographics, i.e. your target audience. For example: How an automotive CRM connected to a car dealership’s blog can empower marketers. Site visitors read a particular blog post before visiting the 2021 Honda CR-V product page, requesting information or making a purchase! The automotive CRM confirmed the blog post had content on the five best cars for young professionals The CRM also confirmed the inquires and buyers of 2021 Honda CR-V were mostly in their late 20s Conclusion: No marketer hungry for insights will ignore information that tells them how to craft content for specific customer demographics. Refining your buyer persona is essential for doing less work with more resources. Analysis helps marketers create topics and content that truly appeals to targeted audiences. 2. Customer Segmentation CRM tools also help you sort your customers according to their demographics, interests, jobs, company sizes, industry, etc. Customer segmentation can also include pages on your site that customers visited and show their engagement. Engagement varies, and it’s a big topic; however you can set up and view metrics from time spent on site, the content viewed and conversions (sales). Customer segments can go further, too, assisting with your marketing content and their publication schedules. For example: A law firm uses a CRM to monitor its online client activities on its website. The CRM reveals visitors of various ages watching specific videos at different times as well. The legal office can categorize these visitors into, e.g.: 40-year-old couples viewing divorce-related video materials on late weeknights Aged 30-something professionals watching overviews on managing workplace conflict during weekday lunch breaks Middle-class residents consuming videos about land disputes every Sunday afternoon, etc. With this hyper-specific information, the law firm can easily determine the best content to create for which audience group on which days and times. This is advantageous, especially if you have a diverse clientele and suite of service offers. 3. The Customer Journey Not all website visitors immediately convert and buy your products and services. Some take time, but every consumer typically goes through a series of phases in their interaction with a business. Marketers call this the customer journey, which usually has the awareness, consideration, and purchase (or decision) stages. A CRM tool helps you determine and track your customers’ progress by extracting updated data from several sources and organizing prospects accordingly. Knowing prospects’ specific stages of their journey is crucial since each stage requires a unique set of marketing tactics to get their buy-in. This intel helps you develop relevant, targeted messages that resonate with your intended audience for your content marketing campaigns. For example: How an eCommerce retail shop sells herb-infused beverages. The CRM reports reveal how long it takes for a customer to purchase by measuring site activities. For example, the site visitor may read several blog posts, repeatedly visit the product page, and put items in carts — but later abandon the cart. The eCommerce retail shop can review the website content and sales strategy and conclude why the cart abandonment was how the invitation to buy was presented within the blog posts content. The blog topics were likely to be niche and relevant to site visitors who already know the product. For the visitors that need more steps in the buying process, e.g.choosing the best flavor for their nutritional needs or understanding garment sizing before adding a shirt to the cart, revise the content and sales process to include the extra step. Plus, remember to match your content appropriately with the stages of progress, including: Awareness: blog and social media posts, educational webinars, checklists, whitepapers, kits, tools, tip sheets, ebooks, how-to videos Consideration: free sample, case study, product comparison guide Decision: coupons, live demo, free trial, consultation offers 4. Repackaging High-Performing Content CRM reports will present data on the content and campaigns that yield optimal results. Leverage all insights when planning your content and reuse or repackage the material to engage your intended audience. Probe into your best-performing content according to the CRM insights. Check its compelling elements and apply the same for your next content pieces. Creating templates will be great when reusing the content. You can also repackage it in other forms. For instance, you can turn a case study into videos, infographics, webinars, blog posts, etc. Final Thoughts You can get a lot more from a CRM than just a data repository. Information is power, and in this blog post, we highlighted how using more features of your CRM can help you make your content marketing work harder for your business.', 'preprocessed_text': 'use cry optic content market cry tool man feature user know exist let along use fact software man feature user topic use liken uptake part rule feature use imagine lost opportune market team use feature article look cry use feature help optic content digit market table content cry cry stand custom relationship manage use nurture consume interact drive busy success specify help follow identify profit sale opportune store rule prospect buyer inform document service problem verse market campaign et cry help harmony manage task sale market custom relationship feature cry feature include contact lead task campaign manage sale data analyst dashboard report gene sale forecast market auto content database image repository library mobile cry use feature plus tailor feature industryspecif cry industryspecif cry example automat industry cry custom meet dealership unique lead manage need industry also custom cry include healthcare manufacture commerce legal account real estate next question use cry optic content market campaign optic content market let u look cry improve content market success rein buyer persona target capture store organ custom inform i buyer persona within cry use data capture cry uncle insight custom action journey inter great rule content market campaign target specify custom demography i target audience example automat cry connect car dealership blog embow market site visitor read particular blog post visit gonna cry product page request inform make purchase automat cry confirm blog post content five best car young profession cry also confirm inquiry buyer gonna cry mostly late conclude market hungry insight ignore inform tell craft content specify custom demography rein buyer persona essential we work resource analysis help market great topic content truly appeal target audience custom segment cry tool also help sort custom accord demography interest job company size industry et custom segment also include page site custom visit show engage engage vary big topic how set view metric time spent site content view covers sale custom segment go assist market content public schedule example law firm use cry monitor online client active website cry reveal visitor various age watch specify video differ time well legal office category visitor beg yearly couple view divorcerel video mater late weeknight age some profession watch overview manage workplace conflict weekday lunch break middleclass reside consume video land dispute ever sundae afternoon et hyperspecif inform law firm easily determine best content great audience group day time advantage expect diver client suit service offer custom journey website visitor impede convert buy product service take time ever consume topic got sari phase interact busy market call custom journey usual away consider purchase decks stage cry tool help determine track custom progress extract update data sever source organ prospect accordingly know prospect specify stage journey crucial since stage require unique set market tactic get buying inter help develop rule target message reason intend audience content market campaign example commerce retail shop sell herbinfus beverage cry report reveal long take custom purchase measure site active example site visitor may read sever blog post repeatedly visit product page put item cart later abandon cart commerce retail shop review website content sale strategy conclude cart abandon invite buy present within blog post content blog topic like nice rule site visitor already know product visitor need step buy process echoes best flavor nutria need understand garment size ad shirt cart revise content sale process include extra step plus remember match content appropri stage progress include away blog social medium post educe seminar checklist whitecap kit tool tip sheet book how video consider free sample case study product comparison guide decks coupon live demo free trial consult offer repackage highperform content cry report present data content campaign yield optic result leverage insight plan content revs repackage mater engage intend audience probe bestperform content accord cry insight check compel element apply next content piece great template great revs content also repackage form instant turn case study video ideograph seminar blog post et final thought get lot cry data repository inform power blog post highlight use feature cry help make content market work harder busy', 'len-raw-text': 1077, 'len-preprocessed-text': 670}, {'_id': ObjectId('669e66a690a28c851b9dcf57'), 'url': '', 'category': 'Business & Finance', 'title': '', 'text': 'Is Your Content Authentic And Trustworthy? \\n   Is your content marketing authentic and trustworthy? Or is it regularly misused for advertising and sale pitches? This article shares insights on how your content marketing can engage customers, improve your brand, and increase website traffic and rank. First, rule out what you shouldn’t do with your content marketing. Table of Contents Avoid The Selling Trap Time is money, and content marketing incurs a lot of time. Plus, you’re dipping into your marketing budget if you’re using a third party, i.e., a copywriter, to create your blog posts and articles. However, this doesn’t afford you any leeway to add sales pitches. 🙂 The fastest way to disengage with customers and damage your credibility as a trusted advisor is to ‘blow your own trumpet’ overtly or attempt to disguise selling as something else of value in your content marketing content. All businesses need a sales strategy, including posts on platforms your customers frequent. For example, when you need to push a new product or promotion, be transparent and construct your advertisement in a campaign that lets your audience know you have something to share about your business, product, or service. Sneak in the sales pitch. In your email marketing posts on social media and your website, you can use long-form content like an ‘advertorial’ but call it what it is instead of using content marketing to ‘sneak in the sales pitch’ somewhere, hoping to fool your audience. An example of selling in a blog post is using an anchor like ‘click here’ for more information, and the linking page is to an online shop, not to more detail on the topic presented in the article’s content. Consumers only need to experience this insult to their intelligence once to leave them with a negative impression of your business. Maybe it’s not your fault as you or your marketing team were wrongly advised by a third party like a link builder. Or that you, as an outreach marketer, caved in when pressured by your client to get ‘do follow’ links to their home page. According to Google, did you know all sponsored links in content need to be identified as such? When accepting guest posts, publishers need to be vigilant and mark external links sponsored as sponsored, no, follow, or both. How to Create Content That’s Authentic Highly informative articles focusing on knowledge transfer don’t just work hard in the short term. They’re everlasting insofar as good content is always found in searches and shared. It’s this content that Google ranks highly, too, so wasting time with subterfuge actions that your customers are not fooled by is counterproductive. Start working on a long-term strategy for your content marketing with unique, relevant content that genuinely resonates with your audience. Write content that inspires you. When you’re writing your own content, it’s a lot more enjoyable when it’s on a topic that interests you. Your writing style will ooze your enthusiasm for the subject, keeping your readers engaged. External input from leading authorities. When searching for experts and articles on the same topic, the Internet is your best friend. Search online for keywords relating to your content topic to find out what has been written about it and consider how you can improve their message in your article. Always reference your sources in your content. Introduce facts, statistics, and opinions. All content should show you’ve done your research. Introduce results from surveys and studies and present data and statistics to support your content. Articles that are well-researched and written do take longer. The average article of 1000 words may take up to six hours. However, if you’re not up for writing 1000+ words, every post focuses on quality over quantity. There is no right or wrong answer for how how long a blog post will take, and you’ll never know when you finish it. If you’ve created that article, it will be stand-out and loved by all, including Google. Summing up Many marketers and some businesses are less interested in the long-term gain of content marketing: their content marketing style churns and burns their audience and brand reputation. Stop using short-term traditional marketing strategies for content marketing as it really needs a long-term approach. You can make an immediate impact when you avoid ‘selling’ in blogs, guest posts, and articles. Remember, hiding that you’re just promoting a service or product will fool no one.  Transparency and clear communication are the only way to get more from your content. Blogging is a topic we love, and there’s no end to what you can learn and do with it.

Use three proven strategies not once but all the time! This article focuses on three sure-fire actions you can take to get more traction with your existing and new content contributions. Your blog posts, articles, social media posts, videos, reviews, feedback, and more can work harder for you. The starting point is knowing actions to take and repeat to boost your SEO with your content. The following recommendations are in no particular order; all need your attention as and when required. Let’s start with analytics. Table of Contents Use Customer Journey Analytics Whether you’re using Google Analytics or a more advanced solution, focus on customer journey analytics which tells you much about your users. Deep analytics give you insights into what people like and don’t like. Consider it like having access to a built-in user survey without your readers having to answer a single question. On-page and bounce rates Your website will have pages that get the lion’s share of attention. Look at your website pages with the longest on-page time and lowest bounce rates in your analytics system. These ratings tell you what people are enjoying about your site content. With this information, you can hone in on what attracted users to the page and what is on it that holds their attention. If the page is an article – is it the title, the topic, or how it’s written, the layout using bullet points, headings, images, and videos. Does the page have a call to action, for example, a type of interactive content like a quiz or poll? Knowing how to interpret website analytics is visitor and customer feedback for your marketing campaigns without asking for it! However, capturing the data and learning how to get what you need from it is just the beginning you also need to use to improve your SEO and online performance. Write Click-Worthy Title Tags Google measures user-interaction signals for its ranking algorithm, including click-thru rate. The more clicks your website gets from Google, the more Google will boost your rankings. Click-worthy titles are priceless and serve as the introduction to your brand. First impressions can literally make or break your copy. Keyword Title Tag When drafting your title, develop title tags with a keyword to make it click-worthy. Boring titles do not attract users, and clickbait turns them off. Marketing is a value-based commodity; you do it right if your title draws readers in and your content keeps them engaged. Keywords are the magic words that connect you to readers. Using them in your title will ensure that your work is seen. Use descriptors Be concise and use descriptors. What are readers looking for in your content offers? Use descriptors that differ from existing content title tags so your titles stand out. Reveal Say what you’re offering. Your title is the first thing users see, so make it count. Tell them what they will get, i.e.,10 Healthiest Smoothies for Weight Loss. Original Make it unique, and spark curiosity. Make your title the unicorn in the field of horses. Ask yourself, what would make you stop and read this? Write For the Internet Since one user interaction signal that Google measures is dwell time, the longer someone stays on your article, the better it is for your SEO. Quality The quality of your content is the most crucial way to draw users to your brand. Then to capture users’ attention and keep it, you’ll need to make each word count, keep it concise and offer value. Originality What do you offer that is original and captivating? The element of surprise you offer will draw people toward your brand and keep them coming back. Offer solutions to customers’ everyday challenges, which keeps them engaged with your content. Structure So you need to write using short paragraphs of 1-3 sentences. And you need to break up the text with images, bullet points, and quote blocks to make the page more readable. As you develop content, make sure you write for keywords. Most people searching on Google are looking for answers to questions. Your articles will increase rankings if your content answers questions more succinctly and correctly than your competitors.  You can use these ideas to create helpful content for your readers while paying attention to keywords and interestingly offering answers to their questions. Internet writing is different from writing for print, so it may take a slight shift in mindset as you develop content. Most people do other things while they read, while some only skim through. When you can attract readers with fun, helpful content, there is a greater chance you will retain their focus and offer additional content that will keep them engaged in your brand. Step out and differentiate yourself from the herd of other content providers. Summary Keep it simple and follow these recommendations to get more traction with your content marketing campaigns.  Analytics are your best friend when you know how to read and put them to good use tweaking your content for higher conversion. Content provision is never accessible but a necessity.  Set goals and rewards when your campaigns show you’re heading in the right direction.', 'preprocessed_text': 'content market tip boost so better content market get front ahead competitor use three proven strategy time article focus three surefire action take get traction exist new content contribute blog post article social medium post video review feedback work harder start point know action take repeat boost so content follow recommend particular order need attend require let u start analyst table content use custom journey analyst whether use googly analyst advance slut focus custom journey analyst tell much user deep analyst give insight people like like conoid like access building user survey without reader answer single question snag bound rate website page get lion share attend look website page longest snag time lowest bound rate analyst system rate tell people enjoy site content inform hone attract user page hold attend page article till topic written layout use bullet point head image video page call action example type interact content like quiz poll know interpret website analyst visitor custom feedback market campaign without ask how capture data learn get need begin also need use improve so online perform write clickworthi till tag googly measure userinteract signal rank algorithm include clickthru rate click website get googly googly boost rank clickworthi till priceless serve introduce brand first impress liter make break cops keyword till tag draft till develop till tag keyword make clickworthi bore till attract user clickbait turn market values common right till draw reader content keep engage keyword magic word connect reader use till ensure work seen use descriptor concise use descriptor reader look content offer use descriptor differ exist content till tag till stand reveal say offer till first thing user see make count tell get i healthiest smooth weight loss origin make unique spark curio make till unicorn field hours ask would make stop read write internet since one user interact signal googly measure dwell time longer someone stay article better so quality quality content crucial way draw user brand capture user attend keep need make word count keep concise offer value origin offer origin captive element surprise offer draw people toward brand keep come back offer slut custom everyday challenge keep engage content structure need write use short paragraph sentence need break text image bullet point quit block make page readable develop content make sure write keyword people search googly look answer question article increase rank content answer question succinctly correctly competitor use idea great help content reader pay attend keyword interestingly offer answer question internet write differ write print may take slight shift mindset develop content people thing read skim attract reader fun help content greater chance retain focus offer admit content keep engage brand step different herd content provide summary keep simple follow recommend get traction content market campaign analyst best friend know read put good use tweak content higher covers content proves never access recess set goal reward campaign show head right direct', 'len-raw-text': 885, 'len-preprocessed-text': 478}, {'_id': ObjectId('669e66ac90a28c851b9dcf59'), 'url': '', 'category': 'Business & Finance', 'title': '', 'text': 'The Best Tactics to Keep in Mind When Trying to Write Quality Content \\n   In the world of search engine optimization, content is most definitely king. Today, one of the most impactful and positive things you can do for your site and its outreach is creating fantastic content that your growing audience can read, engage with and learn from. That being said, it can be pretty hard to precisely identify what exactly makes great content. How can you produce the right amount of valuable and shareable content? The unfortunate truth is that you can consistently produce a great flow of new and fresh content and still not get the conversion rate and organic traffic you are hoping for. The reason for that is typical because even though your content is excellent, it is not answering the needs of your audience. Table of Contents Why Your Blog Needs Top Quality Content Your content simply has to be the best, and It has to stand out compared to the competition. Perhaps most importantly, it has to strike a chord with the people reading it, and it typically takes quite a bit of research (but we’ll get to that later). If you are looking for ways to improve your content creation game, here are some tried and true tactics that you may want to consider. Tactics To Improve your Content Keep an eye on social media. You’re probably already pretty tuned in to the activity of your brand on major social media channels. If you’re not, you definitely should be! But that knowledge alone is not nearly enough. Make sure that you expand your attention to social media to capitalize on viral trends or issues that relate to your niche and business. You may be able to identify the very questions your audience merely has by paying closer attention to what conversations are being had on platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and more. Make sure you really know who you’re selling to You must keep in mind that your customers are more than just demographics with variable purchasing power at every stage of your business. When you are thinking of content that you want to specifically get your customers involved in, it is of the utmost importance to consider who they really are. Look at customer notes, comments and complaints to spark up inspiration for your latest content post. Another great way to get inside your customers’ heads is to offer customer questionnaires on your site. Ask them how they feel about your brand. Ask them how they think about your products or services. This will give you ample material to work with when creating content, but it will also help your customers feel more involved in the business and more heard. This will only help lead to greater customer loyalty. Don’t you think understanding your customer base is essential? Consider the research done by Invesp, which found that creating a compelling buyer persona can result in an increase in conversion by an incredible 238 per cent. Check out the competition. In the dog-eat-dog world of business today, there is nothing wrong with looking into where your competitors are succeeding compared to you by taking a look at what kind of content is getting great feedback on the site of your major competitors. You can do this in one of two ways. First off, you can simply look on their site and see what content is getting the majority of shares and responses. The other more in-depth way to figure out what is resonating on your competitor’s pages is by doing a competitor content audit. This will offer you a comprehensive look at what is working in your industry. It is precious information that you can use to improve your digital marketing strategy and your search engine optimization strategy. Another significant aspect of taking a look at your competition is to see what kind of social media influencers they are working with. While you may not want to straight-up poach influencers from your game, you can certainly see how they use influencers and take advantage of their outreach and followership. Research your keywords Indeed, keywords are not quite as impactful as they used to be when it comes to improving the outreach of your site and content (tactics like keyword stuffing are very much a thing of the past), but that does not mean that keywords no longer matter. They totally do! A great way to utilize keywords is to pick up your keyword research to see what people are talking about online, sharing and responding to. You can check keyword research tools such as this list here or just use ahrefs – or another keyword tool. Use essential keywords to think up great title ideas or combine different keywords to develop a great new topic for your blog. Don’t undermine the importance of your title It can be easy to overlook just how crucial a title to your articles are, but missing the first thing that a potential reader sees is a severe mistake. Even when you know exactly what you want to write and have some fantastic ideas about what topics you will cover, take a deep breath and spend 5-10 minutes really thinking about the title of your new work. Better yet, think about talking with some of your coworkers to see if they have any good ideas regarding a title. They might have a completely different approach that can improve the title and the content you are writing about. A title should be quick and concise, draw readers in but not be clickbait. It’s a balance, and with that extra time, you can indeed find that outstanding balance. Research, research, research You want to make engaging and informational content, and one of the best ways to make sure that you actually achieve that goal is to jampack your work with valuable information. Don’t just write two to three pages of puff that doesn’t even teach the reader anything. Another type of research that you want to do is find out what actually works when it comes to content creation. Back in 2017, Buzzsumo looked at 100 MILLION posts to find out what people tend to share and why. The results were incredibly useful when it comes to content creation. For the most part, longer content is more popular. Images are particularly critical to success, and people tend to share things that they are emotionally connected with rather than intellectually connected with. Believe it or not, the most common emotion linked with shareability was awe with 25 percent. The second most popular emotion was laughter was 17 percent. The second was Amusement with 15 percent. Believe it or not, considering what you hear about on the news, anger only took up six percent of shares on social media. It is never a bad idea to include some cold-hard facts in your content either. There is no need to turn your content into a PhD dissertation, but it certainly doesn’t hurt to back up some of your claims with factual information. Don’t forget to optimize So, you’ve done the necessary research and have put your blood, sweat and tears towards creating an exceptional piece of content that your customers will surely enjoy. You’re close to the finish line, but you’re not there yet! Now is the time to take the content you have written and make sure that you optimise your work before publishing by way of on-page search engine optimization. If your writing has a specific, overall focus, chances are you really already have the keywords and concepts necessary. Still, it is important to keep in mind the important SEO you want to keep in mind before you publish: Make sure your meta description is concise yet descriptive Make sure your sub-headers contain keywords and variants Link to authority sites that you have used to build out your content Link to internal pages that are related to the content to keep visitors engaged with your site Add images with descriptive alt text Incorporating visual media such as videos and slideshows is not necessary to the success of your content, but it can definitely help! It is also essential to keep in mind that there is simply no way to predict whether or not a bit of content that you create will be successful or not. Summary As hard as that may be to hear, no amount of hard work necessarily means your new creation is going to gain traction. That being said, if you consistently work to pump out well-written posts loaded with great information and insight, your audience will gradually grow. It will likely take patience – and it could take many months for you to really see the fruits of your labor, but those fruits will come! Content is, in many ways, the personality of your business. It not only gives your audience and customers something to read, but it also lets them know about you, your personality, your interests, and so much more. Don’t consider content just a simple transaction. Use it as a tool. Use it as a way to work out questions you are having within your own business practices. It can be gratifying in more ways than one.

You can only do so much in the day, yet your blogging to-do list could have you in front of your screen 24 hours a day. To be a successful blogger, you have to manage your time and be extremely organized. You’ll need to plan out your day, week and month to ensure that you are producing so your blog can grow. Burn out is very real when blogging and is the reason most fail at it. That, and not seeing results and feeling like your hard work is for nothing. In this article, I will go over some ways to be more productive so you can get more done in less time. You’ll enjoy the success you’re seeing from your blog and also the free time from your productivity. Table of Contents 1 – Time tracking To see where you need to be more efficient with your time, you have to know how you are spending your time working on your blog. Use a time tracker app to segment all of your tasks to see how much time you spend doing each. You may find that you are inefficient with your time. For instance, you should probably do certain tasks together and others at another time. When you’ve figured out how you’re spending your time working on the blog, then you know where you can be most productive, as you will see in the hacks coming up next. 2 – Outsource Let’s look at your content creation process. Let’s say that you spend 20% of your time researching a topic for your post. Then another 10% outlining your post. And 70% of your time writing it. This would suggest that you can do something about the writing segment to make your process faster. The best way is to hire a freelancer to take on some of the work. You could research and outline an article and then pass that on to a writer to create the content. If you find you spend a lot of time doing social media and not creating new content, you should look into hiring a social media manager to take on some of the work. 3 – Batch your work Suppose you are early in your blogging career and don’t have the budget to outsource. You can still do all of the work yourself if you use your time wisely. For instance, batching your work on certain days or certain times is a very efficient way to use your time. Using the same content creation example, you can set aside a day where you only do research. Fill up a spreadsheet with article ideas complete with all the keyword research and outline for each post. Then on another day, do the actual writing. When you do every task one at a time, it is grossly inefficient. Instead of researching, then outlining and then writing, you will find your workflow much smoother by doing each task all at once. 4 – Use your readers to generate content Getting free content is a great way to grow your blog while doing other tasks aside from writing. Having your readers make content for you is a fantastic way to do this. It can come in many forms. You can ask questions in your blog posts on the blog itself and encourage people to answer in the comments. This extra content is usually rich in keywords that can be picked up by Google. Another way is to ask people who have products that you are reviewing to make a short video about how they like the product. You can post the video on your site or make a Youtube channel for a traffic boost without making the videos yourself. 5 – Get some fresh air Spending too much time working on your blog will actually slow down your progress and limit your productivity. You need to get outside and go for a walk or run to get the blood flowing and get some fresh air. This will give you a much-needed energy boost to use when you get back to work on your blog. It can also help you think about things that can help you overcome something that might block your progress. Walking is a great way to clear the mind for problem-solving, so use the time for this instead of looking at a blank screen when you have a writer’s block.', 'preprocessed_text': 'product hack help get done blog ocean woman band blog exhaust also ineffici much day yet blog too list could front screen hour day success blogger manage time extreme organ need plan day week month ensure produce blog grow burn real blog reason fail see result feel like hard work not article go way product get done we time enjoy success see blog also free time product table content time track see need office time know spend time work blog use time tracker ape segment task see much time spend may find ineffici time instant probably certain task together other azoth time figure spend time work blog know product see hack come next outsource let u look content creation process let u say spend time research topic post azoth outline post time write would suggest some write segment make process faster best way hire freelance take work could research outline article pas writer great content find spend lot time social medium great new content look hire social medium manage take work batch work suppose early blog career budget outsource still work use time wise instant batch work certain day certain time office way use time use content creation example set said day research fill spreadsheet article idea complete keyword research outline post azoth day actual write ever task one time grossly ineffici instead research outline write find workflow much smoother task use reader gene content get free content great way grow blog task said write reader make content fantast way come man form ask question blog post blog encourage people answer comment extra content usual rich keyword pick googly azoth way ask people product review make short video like product post video site make youth channel traffic boost without make video get fresh air spend much time work blog actual slow progress limit product need get outside go walk run get blood flow get fresh air give muchness energy boost use get back work blog also help think thing help overcome some might block progress walk great way clear mind problemsolv use time instead look blank screen writer block', 'len-raw-text': 764, 'len-preprocessed-text': 349}, {'_id': ObjectId('669e66b290a28c851b9dcf5b'), 'url': '', 'category': 'Business & Finance', 'title': '', 'text': '3 Content Tips For B2B Marketing  \\n  While content creation can be a challenge for many businesses, B2B businesses seem to have a tough time with content strategy and content creation. Because writing for a business’s decision-makers can be different from writing for a traditional consumer, many businesses writing B2B content struggle. But with the right planning and preparation done before you sit down to actually create any content, you will find just how easy it can be to create content for a B2B business. Table of Contents 3 Ways To Create B2B Content To show you just how this can be done, here are three tips for creating content for B2B marketing purposes and ensuring that that content connects with your target market. 1. Get To Know Your Audience With Personas Just like creating content for B2C businesses, B2B businesses should start by creating personas for the type of customers or clients they want. Not only will this make it easier for you to visualize who you’re creating your content for, but it can also help you narrow down the focus of your content. Solve problems According to Neil Patel, an online marketing guru, the buyer personas you create for B2B content should focus primarily on their problems or struggles and how you, as a business, will address those issues. Once you have this information nailed down, it will be much easier to develop content ideas that will help you fulfill both variables. For example, you can create content addressing the problems that your personas face and how using something like your products or services can show major improvement for their organization. Clearly articulate how your product or service solves your B2B customers’ problems or fulfills their needs. Focus on your unique value and how it aligns with their business objectives. Research and analyze customer data To help create personas, research and analyze your target B2B audience thoroughly. Understand their industry, pain points, goals, and decision-making process. To create buyer personas representing different segments within your audience, consider your existing customers’ benchmarks. Review the existing customer data and reach out to your customers to collect what you need to build your ideal buyer personas. 2. Browse Online For New Topics And Ideas Another way you can find great fodder for content ideas, according to Dan Shewan, a contributor to WordStream.com, is to see what people are talking about online.By tapping into current hot topics in your industry, you may find that your content has a further reach due to people being interested in consuming all they can about this issue or idea. To best do this, you must first know where your target market spends their time online. Once you can find them, getting involved in whatever online communities they’re in can be constructive so you can see what trending topics are being discussed. What you’re doing here is keeping up with conversations. With this information in hand, you can create content for your target personas relevant to you and your business and timely in that it addresses current concerns that people within your industry are dealing with. Personalize your content based on the recipient’s industry, role, challenges, etc. This can be done through targeted email campaigns, personalized landing pages, and relevant content suggestions. 3. Write Content That Adds Value If you’ve been creating content for quite a while, you might feel like you’ve completely maxed yourself out on new ideas. And while this might be partially true, there are always ways to look at things differently or come at an idea from a new angle to help you create an entirely new piece of content. To help you with this, Honey Singh, a contributor to Entrepreneur.com, recommends that you try to find a balance between posting content on a regular schedule that will help your content marketing and SEO efforts with only posting content that you feel adds real value. If this means posting fewer pieces of content, then so be it. Educate However, keep in mind that it’s important to remember that all the content you create for your target demographics should add some kind of value for them. B2B customers often appreciate content that educates them about industry trends, best practices, and emerging technologies. Create whitepapers, ebooks, webinars, and guides that showcase your expertise and provide valuable insights.  Use AI writers to assist you with your content. Every content should have a clear and relevant CTA that guides the reader to the next step in their journey, whether downloading an ebook, requesting a demo, or contacting your sales team. Use Evidence B2B customers are more likely to be swayed by data, statistics, and real-world evidence. To support your claims, incorporate case studies, success stories, customer testimonials, and industry benchmarks. Track the performance of your B2B content using relevant metrics like engagement rates, conversion rates, and lead generation. Analyze the data to identify what’s working and needs improvement, then optimize your content strategy accordingly. Remember that B2B customers are typically more rational and focused on ROI than B2C customers. Your marketing content should build trust, demonstrate expertise, and provide concrete value to help them make informed business decisions.', 'preprocessed_text': 'content tip be market content creation challenge man busy be busy seem tough time content strategy content creation write business decisionmak differ write trait consume man busy write be content struggle right plan prepare done sit actual great content find easy great content be busy table content way great be content show done three tip great content be market purpose ensure content connect target market get know audience persona like great content be busy be busy start great persona type custom client want make easier visual great content also help narrow focus content sold problem accord nail panel online market guru buyer persona great be content focus primarily problem struggle busy address issue inform nail much easier develop content idea help fulfil variable example great content address problem persona face use some like product service show major improve organ clearly article product service sold be custom problem fulfil need focus unique value align busy object research analyze custom data help great persona research analyze target be audience thoroughly understand industry pain point goal decisionmak process great buyer persona repress differ segment within audience conoid exist custom benchmark review exist custom data reach custom collect need build ideal buyer persona brow online new topic idea azoth way find great fodder content idea accord can sewan contributor wordstreamcom see people talk online tap current hot topic industry may find content reach due people interest consume issue idea best must first know target market spend time online find get involve what online common construct see trend topic discus keep covers inform hand great content target persona rule busy time address current concern people within industry deal person content base recipe industry role challenge et done target email campaign person land page rule content suggest write content add value great content quit might feel like complete man new idea might partial true always way look thing differ come idea new angel help great entire new piece content help honey sing contributor entrepreneurism recommend try find balance post content regular schedule help content market so effort post content feel add real value mean post fewer piece content educe how keep mind import remember content great target demography add kind value be custom often appreci content educe industry trend best practice emerge technology great whitecap book seminar guide showcase experts provide valuable insight use ai writer assist content ever content clear rule cat guide reader next step journey whether download book request demo contact sale team use evil be custom like sway data statist dreamworld evil support claim incorpor case study success story custom testimony industry benchmark track perform be content use rule metric like engage rate covers rate lead gene analyze data identify work need improve optic content strategy accordingly remember be custom topic ration focus rob be custom market content build trust demons experts provide concert value help make inform busy decks', 'len-raw-text': 860, 'len-preprocessed-text': 478}, {'_id': ObjectId('669e66b490a28c851b9dcf5c'), 'url': '', 'category': 'Business & Finance', 'title': '', 'text': 'Content Marketing Ideas to Implement in 2022 \\n  The opportunity to invite change in your business and onboard new ideas will benefit the company. To do so needs careful analysis of every aspect of your business. One of the most important departments to focus your attention on is the marketing team. Marketing strategies that worked in a few years ago might not necessarily work as well now, so it is crucial to find new ideas to implement so that your business stays relevant, fresh, and, most importantly, competes well. The key is focusing on quality content for SEO. Here are some content marketing ideas that you can introduce to your team this year that will help you maintain success. Table of Contents Written content Backlinks If you aren’t already doing so, you need to implement a content marketing strategy that focuses on backlinks. In order to bring more traffic to your website, you need to improve your search ranking position on the SERPs. For many, the goal is to achieve that number one spot, or even better, position zero. Although the algorithms can often change, the more backlinks that you have, the more value it will add to your domain authority. However, it’s important to note that the content must be of high quality. Google will spot filler content that is not adding anything of value from a mile off. Therefore, you should make sure that, if you want Google to view your content positively, it must be of high quality. If this isn’t your strong suit, there are content writing services that can help you create high-quality content. Implement a successful link building marketing strategy, and Google will see that you are a company that people can trust, and therefore, your ranking on their search engine should improve. Top Tip: The more influence a site has, the more it will benefit you, so try to reach out to domains of high authority within Google. Blog on your site Creating content around backlinks works, but so does having content on your own website. If you’ve managed to bring the traffic to your site, that is one thing, but being able to keep and make sales is another thing. So, it is just as important to focus on the content that is going on your site. If you still haven’t gotten around to starting a blog, then make now the year to change that. The internet has made it easier to compare different businesses, so you need to find a way that shows the customer you are the company they should do business with. A blog can show customers that you are truly an expert in your field. Video content Written content isn’t going to appeal to everyone. Therefore, you need to find other means of reaching out to as many people as possible. The solution is video. Video content is being hailed as the future of content marketing, and that is probably due to the influx of mobile usage. 75 million people watch online videos every day, through social media and YouTube, and so with these kinds of figures, there is no reason you shouldn’t be jumping on board with video content marketing. Video content offers lots of possibilities in terms of what you can do. Working with a film company can help you to produce a TV advert, a marketing campaign or brand film depending on the budget you have. You can sit down and discuss strategically what video content you would like to produce. Your audience will be a huge factor in what you focus on. For example, if most of your audience spends their free time watching TV, rather than through streaming devices, then the more traditional route of a television advert is more suitable.

There are many ways to go with it; in effect, a blog is your own personal corner of the internet, and it is up to you how you use it. Everyone has one common goal, whatever the style of topic of their blog; to make it successful. For bloggers, success is subjective. Blogging may mean popularity and the potential to make money. Views are what matter most. So the main question is: how to make your own blog? Follow our six tips and you’ll have a good foundation for a successful blogging website. Table of Contents Find your niche This is a rule that isn’t specifically followed for blog users, but for people looking to be creative in general. Finding a niche is all about finding balance; while you want to stand out and be seen by others, which means doing something different and as unique as possible, it still has to be relevant and interesting. If you go too far one way, you’ll get lost in the crowd, but too far the other and there won’t be enough people who want to know what you’ve written to click on your posts and boost the view count. Build your blog on a reputable host provider You’ll need to host your blog on a provider that works for you. There are plenty out there and it’s about finding the right one. Some are more suited to certain styles, more creative, fun blogs for example. Whatever you choose, make sure you go with what is right for the demographic you’re aiming for. Find a host that provides you a server that is close to your target group. That is one of the most important factors while creating an online business. For example, don’t choose a hosting provider that has his server in South Africa while you are targeting users from the US. If you do – then your website loading time will be very slow. The result is that users won’t stay at your website. Do it yourself, don’t hire someone to do it for you Designing a blog is personal, and tailoring a blog is personal too. You shouldn’t hire someone to do this for you because even if they follow your instructions, it’ll never feel quite as pure as when you do it yourself. After all, this article is called how YOU can make your blog a success. The first step is to set it up and design it yourself. Write honest content Whatever your writing principles, stick to them. Be honest, don’t go changing your style or your focus in order to gain more views because in the long run, it’ll not work out. If you stick to what you want to write, at the end of the day you’ll be much happier, and your readership will be much more organic. It may take time to make it work but be patient and don’t move away from why you started your blog in the first place. Go mobile This is another point that is really aimed at a wider audience than just blog users. It is important to move with the times, and technology means that most people are reading articles on smartphones these days. It is important to make your blog mobile-friendly so that people can access it properly out and about. Have fun! Finally, these are among the most important things you must do. If you’re not enjoying the experience, you won’t showcase your best work. Keep the core values of your blog close and make them the reason why you do it. Focus on your authentic content and let the visitors and success find you. From there, everything else will fall into place and who knows?

However, did you know there are some situations where your credit history may indirectly impact your professional life? With nearly 30% of Americans suffering from terrible credit, it’s hard for many people to get out of the credit hole they’ve gotten into. Once you have bad credit, the other financial elements of your life become a struggle, and before you know it, your credit score is preventing you from getting a loan to buy essentials like a car or house! Are you applying for jobs and missing out? Employers do not have to tell you why you missed out on a role, including if it is the reason for your credit score rating. This article examines why everyone should aim for a near-perfect credit score before they need it. Table of Contents Credit Score and Your Career We mentioned earlier that employers can choose what they disclose regarding a role or job application rejection, so you may end up applying for many roles without realizing the elephant in the room is your credit score. Limited disclosure Employers can use limited disclosure to avoid sharing the reasons for rejecting you for a role. Employers can use broad-stroke reasons like ‘you didn’t meet the qualifications’ instead of telling you why you missed out. This answer is unhelpful, as as an applicant, you are likely to make the same error repeatedly and continue to miss out on suitable roles. Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) However, when employers want to do a credit check, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) requires them to seek your permission and get it in writing. Additionally, you may not have known that you can review the report they get. Insist on seeing the credit report and getting professional advice on improving it. Credit report If your credit report is not between 740 and 850, chances are you can improve it. State Laws Some states have laws that restrict credit score use in employment decisions. Currently, there are eleven states. Is your state included? California, Hawaii, Washington, Connecticut, Nevada, Colorado, Delaware, Maryland, Oregon, Vermont, and Illinois. Why Employers Need Credit Reports We’ve mentioned job applications where employment background checks can include reviewing your credit history. Industries with financial responsibility, such as accounting, finance, and roles involving handling company finances, commonly seek a credit report as part of applicant background checks. Financial Roles Most roles involve financial management or fiduciary responsibility and will likely require an excellent personal credit score. Examples of roles in financial services may include bank tellers, loan officers, investment advisors, and anyone handling clients’ money. Individuals applying for fiduciary roles, such as lawyers, trustees, and corporate board members, may also be required to authorize a credit check. Security Additionally, security is another sector, and any role that requires security clearance might require a detailed look at your financial history and credit score. People with high levels of debt are seen as risky as they might be susceptible to bribery or fraud due to economic pressures. Five Actions That Can Harm A Credit Rating 1. Closing an account at the wrong time While this action seems a bit ridiculous, you must decide when to close an account used for a loan. Closing your account too soon after you’ve paid off the balance can harm your loan accounts, such as credit cards. You may have paid off the loan on one account by transferring the balance to another and then promptly closed the nil balance account. While this is a logical step to take, the timing of the account closure can harm your credit rating. 2. Transferring your balances over to one card We’ve all heard of debt consolidation, and it’s not only a convenient solution. You also benefit from a better interest rate, so you’re paying less on the loan amount over time. Many lenders, including the big banks, advertise this strategy to reduce debt; however, if you still need to borrow funds now that all your debt is loaded onto one card, you can appear as a high-risk borrower, which impacts your credit rating. For your credit rating, did you know you’re better off spreading your borrowing over a few credit cards, so each card has a maximum of 30% owed than it is to have one card up with a high credit limit and you’re using most of it? Therefore, debt consolidation may not be excellent if you rely on your current credit score. 3. Keeping charge-offs on your credit report A charge-off is a debt the creditor deems unlikely to pay off because you have failed to meet your monthly payments for a significant period. The account is listed on your credit report as not collectible, where it will remain for seven years, potentially impacting your credit. However, you can sometimes remove your charge-offs before the seven years are up. 4. Falling behind on medical bills You might not realize that if you’ve had a medical bill sitting waiting to be paid for some time, it will ultimately be sent to a debt collection agency to deal with. That can harm your credit, so try to make medical bills your priority if you have a habit of falling behind on payments. 5. Never use your credit card Never needing a credit card should be a sign all is going really well with you financially. However, you must use credit and have a reasonable payment history to get a high credit score. Use your credit card and pay the balance every month. You now have a payment history and zero debt. Final Thoughts Understanding why your credit score is important is connected to what kind of financial future you want to have, which starts with your career. For example, earning a good income, starting or investing in a business, and meeting personal needs like renting or owning a home all require a good credit score. Conversely, ignoring or being oblivious to the importance of your credit score could result in you not reaching your full potential. If you are worried that your credit score might hurt your career prospects, you can take specific measures to improve it. These include improving your credit utilization ratio, making timely payments on bills, paying off any outstanding debts, and rectifying any errors on your credit report.

For budding entrepreneurs and startup visionaries, securing a robust financial footing is paramount to turning innovative ideas into tangible success. In this complex landscape, a business line of credit emerges as a beacon of flexibility and support, offering a lifeline to new businesses that are eager to grow but may encounter unpredictable financial needs. A business line of credit (LOC) is akin to having a reservoir of funds that businesses can tap into as needed rather than receiving a lump sum upfront. A business LOC is a financial tool that’s particularly appealing for new businesses that face the dual challenge of managing day-to-day operations while also needing the agility to respond to growth opportunities or unforeseen expenses. They can draw funds up to a specified limit, pay interest only on the amount used, and replenish the available credit upon repayment. Funding is everything to a startup, so introducing a business line of credit for a new business opens a world of possibilities. It’s not merely a safety net for covering short-term cash flow gaps; it’s a strategic asset that can be leveraged to fuel investment in inventory, equipment, marketing initiatives, or even to smooth out seasonal fluctuations in revenue. This level of financial dexterity is crucial for new businesses still finding their footing in competitive markets. It may not have the extensive economic history required for more traditional loan products. In this broader context, the significance of a business line of credit extends beyond mere financial utility. It represents a vote of confidence in the potential of new businesses, providing them with the means to forge their path with greater assurance and strategic depth. As we delve deeper into the intricacies and advantages of this financial tool, it becomes clear that for new businesses poised on the brink of growth, a line of credit could well be the catalyst that transforms ambition into achievement. Table of Contents Understanding a Business Line of Credit A business line of credit (LOC) is a revolving loan that allows companies to access a predetermined amount of funds, which can be used for various operational needs. Unlike traditional loans, where the borrower receives a lump sum upfront, a LOC allows the flexibility to draw funds up to the credit limit as needed. Interest is only charged on the amount borrowed, not the total credit available, making it a cost-effective solution for managing short-term financial needs. The Lifeline for New Businesses Cash Flow Management For new businesses, which often experience fluctuating revenues and irregular cash flow, a LOC is a buffer to smooth out the financial ebbs and flows. It ensures that companies can cover expenses such as payroll, inventory purchases, and unexpected costs without depleting their cash reserves. Flexibility and Accessibility The flexible nature of a LOC is particularly advantageous for new businesses that may not have predictable financial requirements. It provides the freedom to draw funds as needed, repay, and then reuse the credit, offering a continuous source of capital. Building Credit History Establishing a positive credit history is crucial for any business, and using an LOC responsibly can help new businesses build their credit profiles. This can be beneficial for securing larger loans or better terms in the future. Qualifying for a Business Line of Credit Securing a LOC can be challenging for new businesses due to their limited operating history and lack of financial records. Lenders typically assess a business’s creditworthiness based on credit score, financial statements, cash flow projections, and business plans. New companies can enhance their eligibility by: Maintaining a Strong Personal Credit Score: Lenders may consider the personal credit of the business owners, especially in the absence of extensive business credit history Providing Collateral: Offering assets as collateral can increase the chances of approval and potentially secure more favourable terms. Demonstrating Strong Business Potential: A well-crafted business plan that highlights market potential, revenue projections, and strategic plans for growth can reassure lenders of the business’s viability Strategic Management of a Business Line of Credit Effectively managing an LOC is crucial to maximize its benefits while minimizing costs and risks. Use your LOC wisely by reserving the LOC for short-term needs or emergencies rather than long-term investments. This ensures the credit remains available when most needed. Also, monitor balances and repayments by regularly reviewing the credit balance and making timely repayments to avoid high interest costs and potential damage to credit scores. Additionally, understand the terms by being fully aware of the interest rates, fees, repayment terms, and any conditions that may trigger changes in terms or rates. Final Thoughts It’s not just about having funds available; it’s about creating a strategic financial buffer that empowers businesses to seize opportunities without the constant worry of cash flow disruptions. As these new ventures evolve, the judicious use of a line of credit can play a pivotal role in smoothing out the peaks and valleys of their financial landscape. Moreover, in the fast-paced world of startups and new enterprises, the ability to quickly respond to market demands, invest in emerging technologies, or capitalize on unforeseen opportunities can be the difference between thriving and merely surviving. When managed with foresight and discipline, a business line of credit becomes more than a financial tool—it transforms into a strategic asset, fostering growth and innovation. However, the journey doesn’t end with securing and utilizing a line of credit. It’s equally important for businesses to continuously review their financial strategies, adapt to changing market conditions, and maintain open lines of communication with their lenders. This proactive approach ensures the effective use of the credit line and positions the business as a reliable borrower, potentially leading to more favourable financial arrangements in the future. In conclusion, as new businesses embark on their journey, a business line of credit can serve as a critical component of their financial toolkit, providing the liquidity needed to navigate the uncertainties of the business world. By embracing this financial resource with strategic intent and responsible management, businesses can lay a strong foundation for sustainable growth and long-term success. In the grand scheme of entrepreneurship, a well-managed line of credit is not just a lifeline for today; it’s a stepping stone towards the financial autonomy and resilience that defines tomorrow’s industry leaders.', 'preprocessed_text': 'role busy line credit new busy having finance water establish new busy exhilar daunt bud entrepreneur startup visionary secure robust finance foot paramount turn into idea tangible success complex landscape busy line credit emerge beacon flexible support offer lifeline new busy eager grow may count predict finance need busy line credit lot akin reservoir fund busy tap need rather receive lump sum upfront busy lot finance tool particularly appeal new busy face dual challenge manage daytoday over also need agile respond growth opportune unforeseen expense draw fund specific limit pay interest amount use replenish avail credit upon repay fund every startup introduce busy line credit new busy open world possible mere safety net cover shorter cash flow gap strategy asset leverage fuel invest inventory equip market inti even smooth season fluctuate revenue level finance dexter crucial new busy still find foot compete market may extend economy history require trait loan product broader context significs busy line credit extend beyond mere finance until repress vote confide potent new busy provide mean for path greater assure strategy depth deli deeper intricacy advantage finance tool become clear new busy poi brink growth line credit could well catalyst transform ambit achieve table content understand busy line credit busy line credit lot revolt loan allow company access predetermine amount fund use various over need unlike trait loan borrow receive lump sum upfront lot allow flexible draw fund credit limit need interest charge amount borrow total credit avail make costeffect slut manage shorter finance need lifeline new busy cash flow manage new busy often expert fluctuate revenue irregular cash flow lot buffer smooth finance ebb flow ensure company cover expense patrol inventory purchase expect cost without deplete cash reserve flexible access flexible nature lot particularly advantage new busy may predict finance require provide freedom draw fund need repay revs credit offer continue source capita build credit history establish posit credit history crucial busy use lot response help new busy build credit profile benefic secure larger loan better term future qualify busy line credit secure lot challenge new busy due limit over history lack finance record lender topic ass business creditworthy base credit score finance statement cash flow project busy plan new company enhance big maintain strong person credit score lender may conoid person credit busy owner expect absence extend busy credit history provide collate offer asset collate increase chance approve potent secure favor term demons strong busy potent wellcraft busy plan highlight market potent revenue project strategy plan growth reassure lender business viable strategy manage busy line credit effect manage lot crucial maxim benefit minim cost risk use lot wise reserve lot shorter need emerge rather longer invest ensure credit remain avail need also monitor balance repay regularly review credit balance make time repay avoid high interest cost potent damage credit score admit understand term full away interest rate fee repay term conduit may trigger change term rate final thought fund avail great strategy finance buffer embow busy seize opportune without constant worry cash flow disrupt new venture evolve juice use line credit play pivot role smooth peak valley finance landscape more fastback world startup new enterprise bail quickly respond market demand invest emerge technology capita unforeseen opportune differ thrive mere survive manage foresight discipline busy line credit become finance toolkit transform strategy asset foster growth into how journey end secure until line credit equal import busy continue review finance strategy adapt change market conduit maintain open line common lender proactive approach ensure effect use credit line posit busy reliable borrow potent lead favor finance arrange future conclude new busy embark journey busy line credit serve critic common finance toolkit provide liquid need having uncertainty busy world embrace finance resource strategy intent response manage busy lay strong found sustain growth longer success grand scheme entrepreneurship wellmanag line credit lifeline today step stone toward finance autonomy resile define tomorrow industry leader', 'len-raw-text': 1063, 'len-preprocessed-text': 644}, {'_id': ObjectId('669e66c590a28c851b9dcf61'), 'url': '', 'category': 'Business & Finance', 'title': '', 'text': '5 Ways To Strengthen Your Business For A Financial Crisis \\n  People running businesses have a lot of risks to consider every day. One of the things that scare business owners the most, especially those with startups and small businesses, is the thought of a financial crisis. There are various reasons why a financial crisis can hit a business, an industry, or a country, and no matter how much you prepare, it eventually affects people. For example, consider how a virus outbreak in one country can strangle the GDP of many other countries worldwide. Planning to succeed in every aspect of your enterprise, including staff, sales, marketing, and how you bankroll development, is prudent to survive in business. How to fund a business to manage your budget and everything related is covered in the five ways mentioned below. These approaches can help ensure minimum impact on your business in a financial crisis. Table of Contents 1. Maximize Your Liquid Savings Your assets, easily converted into cash, are called your liquid savings. Since they are readily converted into cash, they are like cash itself. The impact on their value is minimal when they are sold. Several factors need to be present for assets to be called liquid savings. These include the fact that when the market is established, there are a lot of buyers interested in purchasing, and the ownership of your assets can be transferred easily and quickly. Liquid items can include but are not limited to checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposit, and short-term government investments. Cash – Physical currency, such as banknotes and coins, or funds held in a checking account Savings Accounts – Bank savings accounts are considered liquid as they allow easy withdrawals. Money Market Accounts – These accounts often offer higher interest rates than regular savings accounts and maintain liquidity Certificates of Deposit (CDs) – While not as liquid as savings or checking accounts, CDs can still be converted into cash before their maturity date, though penalties may apply Treasury Bills (T-bills) Short-term government securities that are highly liquid and considered low-risk Short-term Investments – Some low-risk, quickly tradable investments like short-term bonds or certain mutual funds can be considered liquid savings Liquid assets are the resources you look at in a crisis, as they can be turned into instant cash at any time. Usually, there are no penalties for taking them out before maturity. Having liquid savings is crucial for financial stability, providing a safety net for unexpected expenses or emergencies. It ensures that individuals or businesses can access funds quickly and without incurring significant losses due to market fluctuations or penalties for early withdrawals. 2. Make a Budget Understanding your financial inflows and outflows is essential for businesses and individuals. It allows you to track your savings, establish an emergency fund, and assess whether you live within your means. Without this knowledge, it becomes challenging to make informed financial decisions. How To Create A Business Budget There is more to creating a business budget than knowing your revenue and expenses. In saying this, if all you know is your sales and costs, it’s a starting point for a budget. This information can let you know if you’re breaking even or growing, but you’ll need more data to set your business to consistently perform in the years ahead. 1. Goals, Targets Experts say it’s best to start your budget with your business goals – creating short- and long-term goals and setting financial targets to achieve them once you have them. To help with the financial targets, you need to know what’s happened to date, and that requires a dig into any historical data, e.g., financial statements, balance sheets, and so on. 2. Expenses, Revenue Do you know your fixed from your variable costs? Fixed costs include rent, salaries, and insurance; variable costs include marketing, office supplies, and utilities. Any expense can be cut or reduced without the business suffering too much. Once you have listed your expenses, including any one-off costs, e.g., technology, equipment, relocation, etc., estimate your revenue from all sources. Use your historical data and knowledge of future sales contracts to generate a revenue forecast. 3. Contingency It is advisable to have a contingency fund to prepare for any unexpected expenses and potential loss of revenue. Allocating a portion of your overall budget, typically between 5% to 10%, as a contingency fund allows for a margin of error in expense calculations. If you feel this percentage is insufficient, you can increase it accordingly. 4. Allocate, Monitor, Review and Revise You’ve now allocated the financial resources to not exceed your projected income. Track your cash flow to ensure that you have enough liquidity to cover your operational needs. Regularly review your budget against your actual financial performance. Adjust your budget as needed based on changes in the business environment. 3. Minimize Your Monthly Bills Ensuring your spending is as little as possible is an excellent practice. That doesn’t mean to start living a minimalist lifestyle immediately. Still, identifying the expenses you can live without is always a good idea, even if you don’t have to cut back on them immediately. But you must be prepared to do it if financial adversity comes your way. You are at an advantage if you are prepared to cut back on your expenses immediately. So keep an eye on your recurring monthly bills. Maintaining a budget will make looking at your monthly spending more accessible and help you determine where you are wasting your money. It could include paying for a landline that you never used to pay the extra fee for a checking account. Regarding the checking account, you can easily opt for a bank that offers free checking accounts. It can also include little things like leaving the heater or the air conditioner on when you leave the office or paying high insurance rates. Whatever the case, it is better to start cutting down immediately. If you don’t, then at least be aware of your expenses. 4. Closely Manage Your Bills Avoiding penalties and late fees is crucial for financial stability. You can ensure you don’t have to pay any extra charges by taking a few simple steps. Start by reviewing all your accounts and bills each month, either manually or with the help of a financial app. Set reminders for payment due dates and consider scheduling automatic payments for recurring bills. Creating a list of all your accounts can also assist with budgeting and keeping track of your expenses. With some planning, you can stay on top of your finances and avoid unnecessary financial burdens. 5. Get Out of Credit Card Debt If you have credit card debt, you can get buried underneath the interest charges you must pay monthly. Pay your credit card debt to reduce your worries and put yourself in a position to build a plan for the future. Once your debt is gone, you can start investing in more important things. Alternatively, you may be using a credit card to fund your business – if so, consider a virtual credit card for managing spending and tracking transactions per user. Conclusion In business, you need to expect the unexpected and plan for every eventuality. We live in a global economy, so the industry is wildly unpredictable. Your business can weather any storm when you have a well-thought-out plan. As the saying goes, ‘People don’t plan to fail; they fail to plan.’ When times get tough, you can avoid falling into business failure by taking the time and resources to adequately prepare for the challenges that lie ahead so your business can thrive no matter what. The best opportunities are often found during adversity, and the prepared businesses come out on top.', 'preprocessed_text': 'way strengthen busy finance crisis people run busy lot risk conoid ever

CPAs Protect Small Businesses   \\n Certified public accountants (CPAs) can mitigate a business’s financial risk; to do so, they are more qualified than accountants. For example, in addition to a bachelor’s degree (the bare minimum requirement), CPAs have passed a regulatory exam like the U.S. Uniform CPA Exam and have work experience. CPAs are qualified to provide financial advice to business managers. To engage a CPA, their qualifications come at a premium, whether recruiting one or enlisting a third-party service. A CPA’s extensive education and expertise command a big salary, between five and six figures, depending on experience and seniority. The cost of their services, however, varies by location. Large companies need a CPA’s proficiency, and Small businesses need them just as much for reasons ranging from tax preparation to forecasting growth. Table of Contents Migrating Business’ Financial Risk How does CPA mitigate a business’s financial risk? Internal control Internal control is a less-explored aspect of business growth, but a lack thereof can be deadly. A study published in the Review of Accounting Studies states that accounting fraud cases occur in two out of five companies. As a result, publicly traded businesses lose 1.6% of their collective equity annually; in 2021, the loss was valued at USD$830 billion. Among the most common incidents involve misappropriating business funds, sometimes called embezzlement. Without the proper means to track cash flow, dishonest employees can get away with close to millions by using a legitimate expense as a front. By the time the owner discovers the deception, the company will have lost so much to the point of closure. While a CPA is not required to audit a business, they can assume some essential responsibilities to improve internal control. Examples include: Reviewing receipts and other documents reporting expenses Confirming assets and evaluating inventory procedures Educating employees and clients on the importance of proper accounting Conducting limited background checks on applicants and new hires In a way, a CPA for small businesses is at the forefront of the campaign against corruption and fraud in a business or organization. The International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) stresses that accountants are in a prime position to mitigate the effects of such acts in the public and private sectors, regardless of size, through their work. Tax compliance In September, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced it would adopt AI to go after high-income enterprises that owe millions in back taxes. Among those on the list are dozens of significant partnerships with over USD 10 billion in assets. This reinvigoration of a federal agency that has been underfunded for years should be a wake-up call for business owners to fulfill their tax obligations. Small players with limited revenue and capital can’t afford to earn the agency’s ire, as the penalties can quickly stack up against them. For instance, failure to file taxes on time slaps a 5% penalty for each month of delay and can go up to 25%. There are multiple reasons for such delays, one of which is the struggle to grasp the convoluted federal tax code. It also doesn’t help that the business is responsible for filing other than income tax, such as estimated, employment, and excise taxes. Tax planning and preparation are within the CPA’s list of expertise. Although not as specialized in the procedure as licensed tax preparers, they have extensive knowledge of business tax policies, including potential tax breaks. A company that hires one usually doesn’t need a tax preparer, especially if it needs know-how beyond taxes, such as preparing financial statements. Unlike tax preparers, CPAs are one of a few professionals who can be endowed with the Power of Attorney. With this authorization, they can represent the business on its behalf before the IRS, receiving its tax information and disputing applications of tax policies. A Power of Attorney will last until the business revokes it or appoints a different eligible individual. Financial audit Occasionally, the IRS conducts randomized, independent audits of taxpayers’ returns. While an audit by no means implicates one of an accidental error or possible fraud, it can make business owners understandably nervous. It’s estimated that these audits occur in 1% of tax returns each year, but businesses can increase their chances of being dragged in one in various ways, not the least of which include the following conditions. Revenue increase warranting movement to a different tax bracket Filing income tax when there’s no taxable income to report Filing income tax with transactions from investors and partners Failure to report all taxable income, especially if the IRS can trace it Deductions like home office expenses or using a personal vehicle for business If yours happens to be picked for an audit, the agency will inform you through telephone or mail (never via email). The letter comes with other documents, primarily Form 4549, which outlines the agency’s proposed changes to your returns moving forward. Upon receiving it, you have 30 days to review and dispute the proposal if necessary. However, appealing to the IRS is somewhat akin to taking a matter to court, as it requires valid evidence to support your argument. One such document is a certified financial statement (CFS), which can only be certified by an independent CPA. Balance sheets, cash flow statements, and income statements are common examples. As mentioned previously, a CPA can represent your business before the IRS. That’s why it’s never a bad idea to have one working for you. Business consultation While a welcome advantage, a business degree isn’t required to start a business. If household names like Facebook and Microsoft are any indication, a person doesn’t even need a college degree to do so. Regardless of formal education, any startup owner has to fight an uphill battle to achieve long-term success. Product design and marketing are only the tip of the entrepreneurial iceberg. The less thrilling yet more essential aspects, ranging from managing taxes to paying employees and suppliers, lie underneath. However, no other facet of business management is more crucial than that first step—making the call to start one. You don’t want an idea to sound good only on paper. Some experts recommend discussing it with a CPA to determine its profitability by evaluating the associated costs. In a way, your first meeting with a CPA sets your venture up for later steps in getting the startup off the ground. You’ll know a professional who can help you sort bookkeeping functions and tax obligations, among other things. Conclusion A CPA’s broad range of capabilities makes them a fundamental part of the equation for business success. If you ever plan to hire one, remember to make the most of their multifaceted talents by assigning them vital roles in the organization.', 'preprocessed_text': 'mitis finance risk cap protect small busy certify public account cap mitis business finance risk qualify account example admit bachelor degree bare minimum require cap pas regulator exam like you uniform cap exam work expert cap qualify provide finance advice busy manage engage cap qualify come premium whether recruit one enlist thirdparti service cap extend educe experts command big salary five six figure depend expert senior cost service how vary local large company need cap profile small busy need much reason rang tax prepare forecast growth table content migrate busy finance risk cap mitis business finance risk intern control intern control lessexplor aspect busy growth lack thereof deadly study publish review account study state account fraud case occur two five company result publicly trade busy lose collect equity annual loss value us billion among common inside involve misappropri busy fund sometime call embezzle without proper mean track cash flow dishonest employe get away close million use legit expense front time owner disco decent company lost much point closer cap require audit busy assume essential response improve intern control example include review receipt document report expense confirm asset evil inventory procedure educe employe client import proper account conduct limit background check apply new hire way cap small busy forefront campaign corrupt fraud busy organ intern fever account if stress account prime posit mitis effect act public private sector regardless size work tax compliance septum intern revenue service i announce would adopt ai go highincom enterprise owe million back tax among list dozen significs partnership us billion asset reinvigor fever agent underfund year makeup call busy owner fulfil tax oblige small player limit revenue capita cannot afford earn agent ire penalty quickly stack instant failure file tax time slap penalty month delay go multiple reason delay one struggle grasp convolute fever tax code also help busy response file income tax swim employ excise tax tax plan prepare within cap list experts although special procedure license tax prepare extend knowledge busy tax police include potent tax break company hire one usual need tax prepare expect need knowhow beyond tax prepare finance statement unlike tax prepare cap one profession endow power attorney author repress busy behalf i receive tax inform dispute apply tax police power attorney last busy revoke appoint differ big individual finance audit occasion i conduct random indeed audit taxpayer return audit mean imply one accident error possible fraud make busy owner understand nervous swim audit occur tax return year busy increase chance drag one various way least include follow conduit revenue increase warrant movement differ tax bracket file income tax taxable income report file income tax transact investor partner failure report taxable income expect i trace deduct like home office expense use person vehicle busy happen pick audit agent inform telephone mail never via email letter come document primarily form outline agent propose change return move forward upon receive day review dispute propose necessary how appeal i somewhat akin take matter court require valid evil support argument one document certify finance statement of certify indeed cap balance sheet cash flow statement income statement common example mention previous cap repress busy i never bad idea one work busy consult welcome advantage busy degree require start busy household name like casebook microdot indict person even need college degree regardless formal educe startup owner fight uphill battle achieve longer success product design market tip entrepreneur iceberg we thrill yet essential aspect rang manage tax pay employe supplier lie underneath how facet busy manage crucial first steak call start one want idea sound good paper expert recommend discus cap determine profit evil cassock cost way first meet cap set venture later step get startup ground know profession help sort bookkeeper function tax oblige among thing conclude cap broad rang capable make fundament part equal busy success ever plan hire one remember make multifaceted talent assign vital role organ', 'len-raw-text': 1119, 'len-preprocessed-text': 643}, {'_id': ObjectId('669e66d090a28c851b9dcf63'), 'url': '', 'category': 'Business & Finance', 'title': '', 'text': '5 Things That Increase Your Risk of Getting Audited by the IRS  \\n While the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) selects tax returns for audit through a combination of random selection and various risk factors, certain situations may increase the likelihood of being audited. Running a business can be stressful enough, and the last thing you want is to be audited by the IRS. Even when a company has nothing to hide, it can be intimidating to handle an IRS audit. More often than not, getting audited is more severe than the event itself. Most audits are done through the mail and may work out in your favor as long as you are honest. Remember that it is essential to seek professional help if you are struggling with your taxes. The factors mentioned in this article do not guarantee an audit, and many audits are conducted randomly. That being said, below are five things that may put you on the IRS’s radar. Table of Contents Making More Money According to IRS statistics from 2016, if you show a significant increase in income from one year to the next, your chances of getting audited can increase from 0.65% to anywhere from 1.7% to 5.9%, depending on your reported income. In addition to the increase in potential auditing by moving into a new tax bracket, sudden increases in income – especially for self-employed individuals – will be red-flagged by the IRS, even when they are legitimate. Filing Income Tax When It’s Unnecessary If you file an income tax when you had no taxable income for the year, especially if you previously had, you are at higher risk of getting audited. While you must file a return regardless of how much income you made, the absence of income will raise eyebrows in the IRS. Not Reporting All Taxable Income All taxable income is required to be reported to the IRS, especially if it is traceable. The IRS receives copies of all tax forms that you receive. The IRS tracks anything paid to you by other entities, such as salary payments (W-2s or 1099s), dividend income, and interest paid. Tax professionals can review your files before submitting them to ensure you are not missing any pertinent information. Improper Use of Reported Income If you report income used for purposes other than stated, you increase your chances of getting contacted by the IRS. This typically happens when people invest money into an idea. Tax Evasion You are at perhaps the highest risk of getting audited by not paying or purposely underpaying taxes. There are many clues the IRS will look for to find individuals who are participating in tax evasion. Some red flags include claiming 100% use of assets (such as a vehicle) for business, deducting business travel and meals, taking higher-than-average deductions compared to other companies in your field, or anything else that could be seen stretching the truth. This is especially true with self-employed individuals. For some individuals, nothing is more terrifying than getting contacted by the IRS. In reality, these routine audits should be nothing more than a formality you must engage in as a professional. Audits are nothing to be concerned about for an honest taxpayer. More Factors Are you keen to know more factors that may increase your IRS audit risk? Foreign Bank Accounts and Income The IRS is vigilant about offshore income and assets. Failing to report foreign bank accounts or income can lead to severe consequences. Rental Property Individuals with rental properties may be subject to audits, especially if there are discrepancies in reported rental income and expenses. Frequent Use of Cash Transactions A high volume of cash transactions without proper documentation may attract attention from the IRS. Last Few Words Please remember that attempting to evade or avoid an IRS audit through illegal or unethical means is not advisable and can lead to severe consequences. The IRS has various methods to identify and address non-compliance. To state the obvious, it’s essential to be honest and accurate when filing your taxes. If you’re unsure about certain deductions or have complex financial situations, consider seeking advice from a tax professional to ensure compliance with tax laws.

Popular subscription-based accounting software includes platforms like QuickBooks and ZipBooks. These platforms provide a range of features, including invoicing, expense tracking, financial reporting, and integration with other business tools. However they are not the same and there are differences worth knowing including range in price, features, and even level of customer support. Which is the best for your bookkeeping needs? Let’s find out. Table of Contents ZipBooks Designed to be the perfect fit for small entrepreneurs. In other words, startups and micro-businesses that have minimal transactions to record every month can benefit significantly from ZipBooks. It is an excellent ‘starter’ accounting program for entrepreneurs or freelancers and clearly better than using computer spreadsheets or handwritten ledgers. Dashboard The ZipBooks Dashboard includes Quick Stats, Accounts Receivable, Key to Bar Graph, and your Business Health Score. Quick Stats is a section that offers an instant snapshot of revenues collected over the past year as well as the previous month’s net income. A current-to-date accounts receivable balance is displayed, and there is the option to click for more details under the categories of View Report, where you can dig deeper into the Aging A/R stats. A bar graph appears, and the key is explained here. Blue shows revenue, gold is expenses, and green indicates profit. The green bar shows in red when expenses are more significant than revenue. Business Health Score will show a figure out of 100. If the number is low, you can click on it, and the ZipBooks program will provide suggestions on improving your bookkeeping setup. Customer Service While both ZipBooks and QuickBooks provide customer service when compared head-to-head, QuickBooks offers much more than ZipBooks. Here is a look at what each provides: Zipbooks provides multiple options for customer services, including chat and helpdesk. All you have to do to reach a ZipBooks support agent is log into your account and click the “Start A Conversation” (lower right corner of the screen). You can search for assistance by typing a keyword or two into the search window. The Accounting Basics section has several FAQs and step-by-step instructions on how to start using this program. Pricing There are a total of four different pricing plans. They range from $0 to $125 per month. Here is a look at each: ZipBooks Starter is free and provides access for one user. It allows you to produce an unlimited number of invoices and unlimited customer/vendor contact tracking. It connects to a single bank/credit card account. Another ZipBooks Smarter starts at $15 per month, but it gives you the ability to have an unlimited number of users. You can automatically send unlimited recurring invoices and track hours worked by contractors/employees. This program will quickly transfer those hours to customer invoices. ZipBooks Sophisticated starts at $35 per month and includes everything in the ZipBooks Smarter program with some extras. They include tracking of income/expenses by location/project. You will also be able to create bank reconciliations, and there are advanced reporting features. The last, ZipBooks Services, is the top level, costing $125 monthly. It provides a dedicated bookkeeper who will categorize all transactions and reconcile bank and credit card accounts, plus one more feature. You will have someone who will prepare monthly financial statements for you. QuickBooks for Mac On the other hand, QuickBooks is designed to fit well with any size business and is the best-known of the pair. It has many more features and has a vast network of advisors. Plus, QuickBooks is used by more businesses than any other software program. It has three different business tiers designed to fit various-sized enterprises. While it is a good fit for entrepreneurs, medium-sized companies, and giant corporations, this program is more expensive. However, it has several more features than ZipBooks. Dashboard The QuickBooks Dashboard contains a Left Menu Bar, Sales, Profit and Loss, Expenses, and Invoice tabs. The left menu is a multi-functional menu bar as it gives you access to most program features in the same way keyboard shortcuts would. The sales section gives you a visual of sales figures with an ongoing updated current figure for reference. Then, you can monitor the profit and loss situation of your business without having to run a report for the same data. QuickBooks offer omnichannel customer support, including chat, phone, email, knowledgebase, guideline, and various tutorials. You can reach a QuickBooks support agent by logging into your account and clicking the ‘Help’ option. You can phone to speak to a support agent six days a week (6 AM – 6 PM PST on weekdays, 6 AM – 3 PM PST on Saturdays). A free course with video tutorials and written instructions to aid you in setting up your bookkeeping program. There are a total of three different pricing plans. Here is a look at each of them: Pricing Simple Start is $15 per month and allows access for just one user. It will create invoices and track accounts receivable. The second plan is Essentials, which costs $35 per month and includes all of the features in Simple Smart plus some extras. They have unpaid bill tracking, check printing, and access for up to three users and two accountants. And the third plan starts at $50 per month and comes with all the Essentials features. Added to this is access for up to five users and two accountants. Additional extras are tracking reports for 1099 contractors, budgeting/forecasting tools, and project tracking. Ease of Use Both ZipBooks and QuickBooks for Mac are designed to be user-friendly. Plus, you do not require a bookkeeping background to use or understand how these programs work. Both utilize simple language rather than industry terminology, aiding the user experience. The main difference at startup is the dashboard’s appearance on each program. Here is a look at each of them: In Conclusion The decision on which of the accounting software programs, ZipBooks or QuickBooks, is best for your business depends on the size of your business. Both can accommodate any size company, although ZipBooks is probably best suited for smaller entrepreneurs. If you demand more features, then QuickBooks would be your obvious choice.', 'preprocessed_text': \"zipbook versus quickbook mac win game subscriptions account software offer sever advantage include regular update access anywhere internet connect scalable often lower upfront cost compare trait onpremis software popular subscriptions account software include platform like quickbook zipbook platform provide rang feature include invoice expense track finance report inter busy tool how differ worth know include rang price feature even level custom support best bookkeeper need let u find table content zipbook design perfect fit small entrepreneur word startup microbus minim transact record ever month benefit significantly zipbook excel starter account program entrepreneur freelance clearly better use compute spreadsheet handwritten ledger dashboard zipbook dashboard include quick stay account receive key bar graph busy health score quick stay section offer instant snapshot revenue collect past year well previous month net income currenttod account receive balance display option click detail category view report dig deeper age a stay bar graph appear key explain blue show revenue gold expense green indict profit green bar show red expense significs revenue busy health score show figure number low click zipbook program provide suggest improve bookkeeper setup custom service zipbook quickbook provide custom service compare headtohead quickbook offer much zipbook look provide zipbook provide multiple option custom service include chat helpless reach zipbook support agent log account click start covers lower right corner screen search assist type keyword two search window account basic section sever far stepbystep instruct start use program price total four differ price plan rang per month look zipbook starter free provide access one user allow produce limit number invoice limit customervendor contact track connect single bankcredit card account azoth zipbook smarter start per month give bail limit number user automat send limit recur invoice track hour work contractorsemploye program quickly transfer hour custom invoice zipbook sophist start per month include every zipbook smarter program extra include track incomeexpens locationproject also all great bank reconcile advance report feature last zipbook service top level cost monthly provide medic bookkeeper category transact reconcile bank credit card account plus one feature someone prepare monthly finance statement quickbook mac hand quickbook design fit well size busy bestknown pair man feature vast network advisor plus quickbook use busy software program three differ busy tier design fit various enterprise good fit entrepreneur medium company giant torpor program expense how sever feature zipbook dashboard quickbook dashboard contain left menu bar sale profit loss expense invoice tab left menu multiunit menu bar give access program feature way keyboard shortcut would sale section give visual sale figure onto update current figure refer monitor profit loss situate busy without run report data quickbook offer omnichannel custom support include chat phone email knowledge's guideline various tutor reach quickbook support agent log account click help option phone speak support agent six day week am put weekday am put sturdy free course video tutor written instruct aid set bookkeeper program total three differ price plan look price simple start per month allow access one user great invoice track account receive second plan essential cost per month include feature simple smart plus extra unpaid bill track check print access three user two account third plan start per month come essential feature ad access five user two account admit extra track report contractor budgetingforecast tool project track a use zipbook quickbook mac design userfriendli plus require bookkeeper background use understand program work until simple language rather industry terminology aid user expert main differ startup dashboard appear program look conclude decks account software program zipbook quickbook best busy depend size busy accommod size company although zipbook probably best suit smaller entrepreneur demand feature quickbook would obvious choice\", 'len-raw-text': 1056, 'len-preprocessed-text': 597}, {'_id': ObjectId('669e66e390a28c851b9dcf65'), 'url': '', 'category': 'Business & Finance', 'title': '', 'text': 'How To Keep Track Of Your Business Finances \\n  One of the essential elements of running a successful company is tracking business finances, which involves keeping tabs on business income and expenses. A lack of funds is one of the primary reasons why businesses fail. Cash flow is crucial, so companies must manage expenses by recording receipts, payments, or expenses into an accounting ledger. There are also several benefits of tracking your business finances, including: Managing your money more effectively Identifying spending issues Improving your budgets Promoting savings Remaining focused on your financial goals Keeping tabs on your business finances ensures your company grows well to overcome competition. So, how can you implement various strategies to monitor your business finances? By taking the following actions: Table of Contents Developing A Cash Flow Statement Creating a cash flow statement is the first and most straightforward way to keep track of your business finances. It’s one of the final accounts and provides information regarding an enterprise’s health. For instance, it offers insights into how cash and cash equivalents change over time. Simply, a cash flow statement shows how money gets in and out of the company. In addition, a cash flow statement tells you how you get and utilize money. As such, you’ll be able to track your finances. However, you must come up with a comprehensive cash flow statement. In other words, it should comprise three major sections: financing, investing, and operating activities. One of the best ways to prepare a cash flow statement is to work with experts. However, you can complete the task yourself if you don’t have enough budget to hire a professional. Consider watching online videos and reading blogs on how to make a cash flow statement. Keeping A Separate Business Bank Account Another simple but effective strategy for tracking business finances is to open a separate business bank account. Doing so helps separate your personal and business money. As a result, you’ll know how much money gets in and out of your business. Although separating business and personal bank accounts is necessary for tracking company finances, some business owners still ignore this step. You should avoid this kind of mistake since it could be stressful. For instance, you might struggle to calculate taxes, leading to underpaying or overpaying taxes. Leveraging The Power Of Accounting Software Modern technologies form an integral part of running a business. They help streamline operations to save time and other resources. So, consider integrating new technologies into your business systems. Any company area can benefit from new technologies, and tracking finances is no exception. You can do that by installing accounting software. This application helps store business accounting information in digital form. You can also use it to keep track of business finances. Utilizing accounting software to track business finances is beneficial since it minimizes errors. Tracking finances manually increases the risks of human error, so you won’t get a clear picture of your company’s position. One more advantage of utilizing accounting software is it will lower expenses. For example, you can generate payment and expense reports in no time. This eliminates hiring a whole team for financial data entry and analysis. A few staff members will be enough to complement the already installed accounting software. As a consequence, you’ll reduce labor costs. However, not every accounting software on the market can be suitable for tracking your business finances. You should exercise due diligence to find the right tool for your organization. For example, a housing association’s accounting and financial reporting needs differ from those required by a retail business. Accounting software for housing associations will need to include the following: Ability to track and manage rent payments. Track property-related expenses Integrate with bank accounts Automation of routine tasks such as invoicing and payment reminders Security measures for access Audits tracking changes and user activity Additionally, ensure that you source your accounting software from a reputable vendor. Connecting All Your Financial Institutions Managing various bank accounts from different financial institutions isn’t easy. In that case, you can connect your bank accounts by using accounting software. Connecting your bank accounts lets you manage your finances from a centralized location. Furthermore, it allows you to automatically download and post all your bank transactions to the appropriate ledgers. All this helps you track your business finances more efficiently. For instance, you can account for every payment received or expense incurred by your enterprise. Using Cash Accounting Or Accrual Accounting Basis Cash and accrual accounting are both acceded principles in recording payments and expenses. However, for consistency purposes, you should choose one. Before you track your business finances, decide whether to settle for a cash or accrual accounting basis. With the cash accounting method, you’ll record financial transactions. For instance, you register the payment as income only when received. Likewise, you document expenses once you pay them. On the other hand, an accrual accounting basis requires you to record income and expenses as soon as they occur. Therefore, you won’t have to wait until you receive money or make payments to register on your books of accounts. Using either cash or accrual accounting method gives you a complete view of your business, enabling you to easily track finances. Reviewing Expenses Regularly Regularly reviewing and categorizing business expenses is an effective way to track your finances. Going over your costs allows you to develop a deeper understanding of your business and find ways to grow it. By reviewing expenses regularly, you can control costs as well. You’ll know how much and what you’re spending your money on. You see these everyday figures as a marker to check whether you’re under or over your monthly budget. Apart from becoming financially aware of your expenses, you can determine the proper budget, eliminate bad spending habits, and adopt good ones. Takeaway Whether you and your team have a small business or a large enterprise, tracking business finances is a surefire way to reach your goals. Monitoring finances is essential since it’s one of the best ways to promote growth and ensure your company’s success. Hence, if your business isn’t keeping tabs on its expenses, you should start drafting a plan for managing all your business finances today.', 'preprocessed_text': 'keep track busy finance one essential element run success company track busy finance involve keep tab busy income expense lack fund one primary reason busy fail cash flow crucial company must manage expense record receipt payment expense account ledger also sever benefit track busy finance include manage money effect identify spend issue improve budget promote save remain focus finance goal keep tab busy finance ensure company grow well overcome compete implement various strategy monitor busy finance take follow action table content develop cash flow statement great cash flow statement first straightforward way keep track busy finance one final account provide inform regard enterprise health instant offer insight cash cash equal change time simple cash flow statement show money get company admit cash flow statement tell get until money all track finance how must come comprehend cash flow statement word comprise three major section finance invest over active one best way prepare cash flow statement work expert how complete task enough budget hire profession conoid watch online video read blog make cash flow statement keep spear busy bank account azoth simple effect strategy track busy finance open spear busy bank account help spear person busy money result know much money get busy although spear busy person bank account necessary track company finance busy owner still ignore step avoid kind mistake since could stress instant might struggle calculi tax lead underpay overpay tax leverage power account software modern technology form inter part run busy help streamline over save time resource conoid inter new technology busy system company area benefit new technology track finance except instal account software apply help store busy account inform digit form also use keep track busy finance until account software track busy finance benefic since minim error track finance manual increase risk human error get clear picture company posit one advantage until account software lower expense example gene payment expense report time limit hire whole team finance data entry analysis staff member enough complement already instal account software consent reduce labor cost how ever account software market suitable track busy finance exercise due dig find right tool organ example house cassock account finance report need differ require retail busy account software house cassock need include follow bail track manage rent payment track propertyrel expense inter bank account auto routine task invoice payment remind secure measure access audit track change user active admit ensure source account software repute vendor connect finance institute manage various bank account differ finance institute easy case connect bank account use account software connect bank account let u manage finance central local furthermore allow automat download post bank transact appropri ledger help track busy finance office instant account ever payment receive expense incur enterprise use cash account accrual account base cash accrual account acted principal record payment expense how consist purpose choose one track busy finance decide whether settle cash accrual account base cash account method record finance transact instant resist payment income receive likewise document expense pay hand accrual account base require record income expense soon occur therefor wait receive money make payment resist book account use either cash accrual account method give complete view busy enable easily track finance review expense regularly regularly review category busy expense effect way track finance go cost allow develop deeper understand busy find way grow review expense regularly control cost well know much spend money see everyday figure marker check whether monthly budget apart become finance away expense determine proper budget limit bad spend habit adopt good one takeaway whether team small busy large enterprise track busy finance surefire way reach goal monitor finance essential since one best way promote growth ensure company success hence busy keep tab expense start draft plan manage busy finance today', 'len-raw-text': 1036, 'len-preprocessed-text': 619}, {'_id': ObjectId('669e66e790a28c851b9dcf66'), 'url': '', 'category': 'Business & Finance', 'title': '', 'text': 'The Steps To Starting An HVAC Business \\n  For several reasons, starting an HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) business can be a worthwhile venture. There is a growing demand for the units as they are more energy-efficient than other heating and cooling systems. Plus, your HVAC business can sell the units, installation, and ongoing maintenance services. Providing maintenance services can result in a steady stream of recurring revenue. Many customers opt for regular maintenance contracts to ensure their HVAC systems operate efficiently and avoid unexpected breakdowns. Even during economic downturns, people and businesses still require functioning heating and cooling systems, and as more residential and commercial buildings are constructed, they are continuously needed. However, starting an HVAC business can be a complex process, and it’s essential to understand all the steps involved, from registering your business as an LLC and applying for the necessary permits and licenses to learning about the regulations and understanding the market. If you are already an HVAC technician, then you appreciate the business of HVAC installation and repair. However, as a technician, you’re not automatically set up for success as a business owner. With this Business Blog guide, you’ll have all the information you need to confidently start your HVAC business. Table of Contents Business Basics Your first action in starting a business includes several steps that will vary depending on your location and the type of business you’re creating. Market Research Business Plan Business Structure Regulations and licenses Suppliers Inventory Systems Research All businesses must be thoroughly researched before committing funds – yours and maybe a loan. Before launching your HVAC business, do market research. Be sure you know why you want to have your own HVAC business and that it is for the right reasons. Identify your target market, competition, and potential demand for your product or service in the location or area you wish to operate. Know who your competitors are and if there is room for another operator. Your research will reveal if there are any gaps in products and services that you can fulfill and, therefore, create your own market without direct competitors. For pricing models, consider a subscription service model where your clients pay a monthly or quarterly fee for their HVAC servicing. The subscription service model is attractive to businesses as it helps them ensure they have regular cash flow. The cost of starting an HVAC business ranges from $2000 – $10,000. However, you will more than likely exceed this estimate. Remember to research startup costs so you know you can afford it and, if not, how you will fund it. Your startup costs and projections will be itemized in your business plan. Research Suppliers and Equipment One of the most critical aspects of establishing a successful HVAC business is sourcing quality supplies and equipment from reliable vendors. Start by researching which names are well-reviewed among your peers, and consider talking to veteran HVAC professionals who’ve been in the biz for years. You should also compare prices between suppliers to ensure you get the best deal on materials, tools, and other needed parts. You may get discounts or exclusive pricing if you sign up for their customer loyalty programs or negotiate bulk purchases. Business Plan Create a detailed business plan outlining your goals, target audience, marketing strategy, financial projections, and operational plan. There really is no way around this requirement. For funding, lenders will ask for your business plan, and you will need to ensure it has information on how you plan to fund your business, whether through personal savings, loans, investors, or other means. Your business plan will also detail your staffing requirements, technology needs, marketing and sales strategy, and budget. Business Structure When starting your HVAC business, you will need to decide on the legal structure of your business. Do you want it as a sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company (LLC), or corporation? The structure will impact your liability, taxation, and other legal aspects. The very first decision is to pick the proper business structure. Each entity has other pros and cons, too. For example, an LLC offers limited liability protection but also requires filing fees, while a corporation allows you to have investors but also carries additional compliance requirements and paperwork. Seek professional advice from an accountant before choosing the business structure for your HVAC business. Business Name Choosing a business name for your HVAC company is fun. Make sure it’s unique to do that. You will need to check its availability. Register your business name with the appropriate government authorities. Regulations and Requirements Every business is subject to specific regulations, including those for HVAC businesses. You might need a license, zoning approval, or other local regulations depending on where your business is located. Make sure to research the regulations for your state and county to ensure compliance before you start. Understanding any requirements imposed by insurance companies or other entities is also essential. The initial research you do will help keep you from running into surprise costs down the line. As you must comply with local, state, and federal regulations related to your industry, add what your business needs to your business plan, including costs for compliance. Tax ID, Business Bank Account, Financial Systems Obtain a tax identification number (TIN) or employer identification number (EIN) from the tax authorities. Open a business bank account to separate your business finances from personal finances. Then, choose an accounting system to manage your finances. To manage cash flow, use an online SaaS subscription model like Xero. Once you have organized your account, it is time to set up a system for invoicing, tracking expenses, and managing cash flow. Insurance We recommend getting business insurance, including premises, contents, limited liability, and professional indemnity. Insurance is necessary for risk mitigation and asset protection. If you have staff, you will also need Workers Compensation Insurance. Hire Staff Your business will need staff, and they will most likely be employees. In your business plan, establish a hiring process and create job descriptions. Familiarize yourself with employment laws and regulations. Your newly hired technicians will need to be HVAC certified. Hire technicians who are either already approved or cut down on costs in the early stages of your HVAC startup, including an apprenticeship program. It’s important to remember your reputation as a quality service business will depend on your technicians having completed their apprenticeship or gone to trade school, technical school, or community college. Marketing and Sales Develop a marketing strategy to promote your business. This could include online marketing, traditional advertising, and other promotional activities. A relevant and detailed marketing plan will ensure your HVAC business gets prospective customers. To grow your pipeline of prospective customers, have a website, and invest in SEO to rank highly for local keyword searches. There’s no harm in having profiles on social media platforms to increase your reach and launch online ads that target a specific audience, such as homeowners in your area. Traditional marketing tactics like printing coupons and distributing business cards to local shops, restaurants, and other businesses also work. Utilizing multiple methods can help you attract more clients quickly and establish yourself as an expert in the industry. You will need to know how to sell and close to turn prospects into actual customers. Develop a sales strategy and templates for your salespeople so there is consistency and a steady, proven system for customer acquisition.

\\n   Financial distress for business owners can result from a variety of factors. Some causes are unforeseen and uncontrolled, like an economic downturn and regulation changes. There are also plenty of causes of business distress that directly result from something the company or management did or failed to do. This article focuses on what a business can control and foresee and what is required to turn a company from dying to thriving. First, let’s consider why businesses need to be profitable. Table of Contents Why Businesses Need To Be Profitable Many startup businesses are in the red and then get to break even. However, to survive, companies need to make a profit, and there are several crucial reasons. Sustainability Profit is essential for the long-term sustainability of a business. It provides the necessary funds to cover operational expenses, invest in growth, and adapt to changing market conditions. Investment and Growth Businesses need to be competitive to attract customers and to do this, they need to become sustainable. Funds are required for reinvestment in the business, which could involve expanding operations, developing new products or services, upgrading technology, or entering new markets. Without profits, a business may struggle to fund these growth initiatives.  If the funds can not come entirely from profit, the company must attract capital from investors. Investors and lenders are more likely to support businesses that demonstrate a track record of profitability. Capital providers want to see a return on their investment through loans or equity investments, and profits signal that the business can deliver this. Attract and Retain Staff A profitable business can attract and retain talented employees by offering competitive salaries, benefits, and career development opportunities. Employees are more likely to stay with a company that can provide stability and growth. Technology like AI and automation can do many tasks in most business areas today. However, human staff are needed for strategic roles in marketing and sales, customer support, and operations management. Risk Management and Obligations Profit serves as a buffer against unforeseen challenges and risks. It provides a financial cushion to help a business weather economic downturns, industry fluctuations, or unexpected expenses. Businesses must meet various financial obligations, such as paying suppliers, servicing debts, and fulfilling employee commitments. A company may struggle to meet these obligations without profit, leading to economic instability. Common Causes Of Financial Distress Now we know why a business needs to be profitable, let’s look at common causes of financial distress. 1. Poor Financial Management and Cash Flow Inadequate financial planning and monitoring is often the start of the demise of a business. Without it your business can not prepare of events that will challenge your revenue. With enough revenue to cover expenses, your business can keep operating. However, there is always financial stress when a company is just breaking even.  Any negative event can push the business into the red and negative cash flow. To survive, all businesses need to be profitable.  We recently updated an article on the topic of cash flow for the self-employed, in which many small businesses are budding startups. Solution Implement robust financial management practices, regularly review financial statements, and seek professional advice. Improve invoicing and collections processes, negotiate better payment terms with suppliers, and maintain a cash reserve for emergencies. 2. High Levels of Debt There are two types of debt. Good debt and bad debt. Which do you have? Good debt is typically associated with investments that have the potential to increase in value over time. Examples include student loans (investing in education), mortgages (investing in real estate), and business loans (investing in a business). Loans for investments that also have low interest rates are the best. For example, mortgage rates and student loan rates are often lower than interest rates on credit cards Excessive debt and high interest payments can strain finances.  Additionally, all that debt will be weighing on your mind. Solution Restructure debt, negotiate with creditors for better terms, and focus on reducing unnecessary expenses. Many small business owners use their home loans for business purposes because it is a lower interest rate than a standard business loan. However, this action does come with the risk that if the business fails, the loan repayments still need to be made and the loan repaid within the loan term. 3. Market Competition Intense competition can erode profit margins and market share. Solution Conduct a thorough market analysis, differentiate products or services, and explore new markets or customer segments.  Consider reading the book The Immutable Laws of Marketing to hone your strategies to become a leader in a new market with few or no competitors. 4. Operational Inefficiencies Inefficient processes can lead to increased costs and reduced productivity. Solution Streamline operations, invest in technology for automation, and optimize the supply chain to enhance efficiency.  Use SaaS, which spreads the cost of software services for managing your operations from bookkeeping to marketing. 5. Lack of Strategic Planning The absence of a clear business strategy can result in poor decision-making.  Operating your business without a plan is high risk. Solution Develop a strategic plan, set measurable goals, and regularly review and adapt the plan based on market conditions. Make sure to check your progress by also setting milestones so you know your business is doing what it needs to do to become sustainable. 6. Ineffective Marketing Inadequate marketing can result in reduced customer acquisition and retention.  Being the ‘world’s best-kept secret’ is not what you want for your business. Solution Invest in targeted marketing campaigns, enhance the online presence, and focus on building strong customer relationships. Hire a marketing team who knows how to create a business presence on social media and create relevant content on your website to share with your followers and in a regular email marketing campaign.  SEO is more vital today than ever as Google updates its search algorithms often.  Is your website set up for Google Analytics 4? Final Words Turning a company around often involves a combination of these strategies tailored to the specific challenges faced by the business. Business owners can seek professional advice, engage with stakeholders, and proactively address financial distress to achieve long-term financial success. Awareness of common causes and solutions will enable your business to reverse financial distress into financial success.

Budgeting helps hone a business owner’s focus on performance and income versus spending. Other ways to improve your cash flow include managing your invoices and receivables keeping a close eye on expenses and financing options. This article covers ways you can manage your cash flow better when employed, which is the tax status of most new businesses before they are incorporated. Table of Contents Create A Detailed Budget If your business is financially challenging, creating a budget is the first thing you need to do. When you take the time to budget int, resting revelations occur. For example, you will probably find you’ve been spending more than you’re earning or overspending during months when less income is received. It’s better to be informed and in control rather than deal with the fallout of sudden cash flow shortfalls. When you carefully look at expenses and see what needs to be trimmed, leave everything on the table. For example, underperforming small businesses may need to save money by downsizing office space. Or letting go of your commercial office and setting up remote working for you and your team. If your type of offering needs a workplace, you can consider flexible leasing arrangements or co-working spaces where there may not be a lease. Additionally, if you’re downsizing your office space, you can sell your office equipment and use what’s available in the co-sharing environment. How to create a budget Creating a budget is crucial for managing your finances effectively, primarily when you are self-employed. Develop a comprehensive budget outlining your fixed and variable expenses, forecast income, and an emergency or contingency fund. Expenses Categorize expenses into essential and non-essential to prioritize payments during lean periods. Fixed expenses – e.g., rent/lease, utilities, insurance, loan payments, subscriptions. Variable expenses, e.g., marketing and advertising, office supplies, travel expenses, meals and entertainment, and professional fees (accountant, lawyer, etc.) Forecast Income Project your future income to anticipate potential cash flow gaps when considering your current expenses and when they are due. Consider seasonal fluctuations and irregularities in income. With this awareness, you may find time to consider a side hustle. Set Aside Emergency Funds Establish an emergency or contingency fund to cover unexpected expenses or periods of low income. Having a financial cushion can help you weather temporary setbacks. Consider a Line of Credit Explore the possibility of obtaining a business line of credit to cover short-term cash flow gaps. With a line of credit, you can draw down and repay as and when required to cover shortfalls in cash flow. Use it judiciously and pay it off promptly to avoid accruing excessive interest. Invoice Promptly and Follow Up on Payments Send out invoices promptly after completing a job or delivering a product. Follow up on overdue payments to ensure a steady cash flow. Use Technology for Invoicing and Accounting Utilize invoicing and accounting software to streamline financial processes. Automated systems can help you stay organized and track your cash flow in real time. Choose a service with an app so you can send out an invoice from your phone to speed up the task. You can also receive alerts of payments. Offer Discounts for Early Payments Encourage prompt payment by offering discounts to clients who pay invoices early. Be discerning with whom you work with. Choose clients who pay promptly and reward them accordingly. Negotiate Favorable Payment Terms Negotiate payment terms with suppliers that align with your cash flow cycle. You will want to ensure you are considered a valuable customer so your suppliers provide discounts and the best deals. Seek extended payment terms or discounts for early payments when dealing with vendors. Negotiate either longer payment terms or a cheaper rate for paying early. Diversify Income Streams Managing cash flow when you’re self-employed is an ongoing challenge. You think you’ve got it all sorted out, and then you lose a supplier or customer and, with it, the favorable terms that have helped you manage your cash flow. To ease the burden with your primary offering, explore additional sources of income to reduce dependence on a single client or revenue stream. Side hustles can turn into full-time businesses. Diversification of income streams can provide stability if one income source is temporarily disrupted. Monitor and Control Expenses Regularly review your expenses to identify areas where costs can be reduced. You may have a new budget; however, over time, more payments will be required, so you need to manage your existing outgoings for their relevancy. Cut unnecessary expenses and make a date in your calendar to regularly renegotiate contracts with suppliers if possible. Build Strong Client Relationships: Cultivate strong relationships with clients to encourage repeat business. It is easier to sell to and retain a customer than acquire a new one.  Plus, selling to an existing customer will cost less, and satisfied clients are more likely to pay promptly and recommend your services. Regularly Review and Adjust Periodically review your cash flow management strategies and adjust them based on your business’s evolving needs. Be flexible and adapt to changes in the market or your industry. By implementing these steps, self-employed individuals can enhance their ability to manage cash flow effectively, reducing financial stress and promoting the long-term success of their businesses. Keep Business and Personal Finances Separate According to Inc. Magazine, small business owners must maintain separate business and personal expenses accounts. Otherwise, you risk putting too much of your personal funds into your business. With a business bank account, you can automatically transfer data to your tax and financial statements, making the accountant’s job easier and cheaper. Pay Yourself the Market Rate Inc. also advises small business owners to not undercut their own salary. Many small business owners try to low-ball bids beyond a figure that allows them to make a living wage. Charging too little harms cash flow and makes sticking to a budget tough. Later, you will have to charge customers more for your products or services. Get Financial Advice from a Professional There is so much to do when you are in business for yourself. It is okay not to know everything. If you are not a financial professional, it makes sense to consult the services of a financial planner for small business owners when you get in a bad situation. The Small Business Administration has retired business professionals who can provide advice on budgeting, marketing, and financial planning. Their advice is free.', 'preprocessed_text': 'improve cash flow self employ manage cash flow crucial selfemploy individual ensure stabile success busy budget help hone busy owner focus perform income versus spend way improve cash flow include manage invoice receive keep close eye expense finance option article cover way manage cash flow better employ tax state new busy incorpor table content great detail budget busy finance challenge great budget first thing need take time budget in rest revel occur example probably find spend earn overspend month we income receive better inform control rather deal fallout sudden cash flow shortfall care look expense see need trim leave every table example underperformed small busy may need save money downsize office space let go commerce office set remote work team type offer need workplace conoid flexible lea arrange work space may lea admit downsize office space sell office equip use avail costar environ great budget great budget crucial manage finance effect primarily selfemploy develop comprehend budget outline fix variable expense forecast income emerge counting fund expense category expense essential nonessential priority payment lean period fix expense beg restless until insure loan payment subscript variable expense beg market advertise office supply travel expense meal entertain profession fee account lawyer et forecast income project future income antics potent cash flow gap conoid current expense due conoid season fluctuate irregular income away may find time conoid side hustle set said emerge fund establish emerge counting fund cover expect expense period low income finance cushion help weather temporary setback conoid line credit explore possible obtain busy line credit cover shorter cash flow gap line credit draw repay require cover shortfall cash flow use juice pay promptly avoid accrue excess interest invoice promptly follow payment send invoice promptly complete job deli product follow overdo payment ensure steady cash flow use technology invoice account until invoice account software streamline finance process auto system help stay organ track cash flow real time choose service ape send invoice phone speed task also receive alert payment offer discount early payment encourage prompt payment offer discount client pay invoice early discern work choose client pay promptly reward accordingly negate favor payment term negate payment term supplier align cash flow cycle want ensure conoid valuable custom supplier provide discount best deal seek extend payment term discount early payment deal vendor negate either longer payment term cheaper rate pay early diversify income stream manage cash flow selfemploy onto challenge think got sort lose supplier custom favor term help manage cash flow a burden primary offer explore admit source income reduce depend single client revenue stream side hustle turn fulltim busy diversify income stream provide stabile one income source temporarily disrupt monitor control expense regularly review expense identify area cost reduce may new budget how time payment require need manage exist outgo rule cut unnecessary expense make date calendar regularly renegoti contract supplier possible build strong client relationship cultic strong relationship client encourage repeat busy easier sell retain custom acquire new one plus sell exist custom cost we satisfy client like pay promptly recommend service regularly review adjust period review cash flow manage strategy adjust base business evolve need flexible adapt change market industry implement step selfemploy individual enhance bail manage cash flow effect reduce finance stress promote longer success busy keep busy person finance spear accord in magazine small busy owner must maintain spear busy person expense account otherwise risk put much person fund busy busy bank account automat transfer data tax finance statement make account job easier cheaper pay market rate in also advise small busy owner undercut salary man small busy owner try lowball bid beyond figure allow make live wage charge little harm cash flow make stick budget tough later charge custom product service get finance advice profession much busy okay know every finance profession make see consult service finance planner small busy owner get bad situate small busy administer retire busy profession provide advice budget market finance plan advice free', 'len-raw-text': 1093, 'len-preprocessed-text': 652}]), ('Sports', [{'_id': ObjectId('669e67210721cfdbc7ef379c'), 'url': '', 'category': 'Sports', 'title': '', 'text': 'Maxwell takes a break to refresh after asking to be rested by RCB play Glenn Maxwell has elected to take a break from the IPL to refresh himself physically and mentally after requesting Royal Challengers Bengaluru management pick someone else in his place for the match against Sunrisers Hyderabad. Maxwell has been struggling for runs in IPL 2024. Before Monday\\'s game, he had scored only 32 runs in six innings at an average of 5.33. There were speculations that he might have sat out because of a thumb injury but that was not the case. \"For me, personally, it was a pretty easy decision,\" Maxwell said after RCB\\'s sixth defeat in seven matches. \"I went to Faf [du Plessis] and the coaches after the last game and said I felt it was probably time we tried someone else. I have been in this situation in the past where you can keep playing and get yourself deeper into a hole. I think now is actually a good time for me to give myself a bit of a mental and physical break, get my body right. If I\\'m required to get in during the tournament, I can hopefully get back into a really solid mental and physical space where I can still have an impact. \"We have had a pretty big deficiency straight after the powerplay, which has been my area of strength over the last couple of seasons. I felt like I wasn\\'t contributing in a positive way with the bat, and with the results and the position we find ourselves on the table, I think it\\'s a good time to give someone else an opportunity to show their wares, and hopefully, someone can make that spot their own.\" Coming into IPL 2024, Maxwell was in red-hot form. In 17 T20s since the start of November, he had 552 runs at an average of 42.46 and a strike rate of 185.85. During this period, he scored two hundreds as well. But he started the IPL with a first-ball duck against Chennai Super Kings. Since then, he has had two more ducks and has lasted more than five balls only once - against Kolkata Knight Riders, when he made a 19-ball 28 with the help of two dropped catches. \"T20 cricket can be like that sometimes - it\\'s a pretty fickle game,\" he said. \"Even if you look at the first game, I ran one off the middle of the bat to the keeper. I picked up the length really well, saw a scoring opportunity, but opened the face a little bit too much. When you are going well, that goes wide of the gloves, you get a boundary, you are 4 off 1, and you are away for the tournament. \"I probably just haven\\'t got away - it\\'s as simple as that. In the first few games, I feel I made reasonably good decisions, but I was still finding ways to get out. It can happen in T20 cricket and when it snowballs like that, you can go searching and try too hard and forget the basics of the game.\" The SRH game, though, turned out to be a high-scoring one. Batting first, SRH posted 287 for 3, the second-highest total in T20 cricket. RCB replied with 262 for 7, making it 549 for the match, the most for a T20. play 2:12 Inside Glenn Maxwell\\'s battle to find form at the IPLThe Australia allrounder talks about how he goes about training, going from a \\'shocker\\' of net one day to one of his best the next Maxwell was asked if, in hindsight, he wished he had played one more game. \"I did notice during the powerplay that the pitch was not as slow and two-paced as it has been in the first few games,\" he said with a smile. \"And I realised it was probably a bad game to miss; it would have been nice to be out there batting. \"But as I said, I wanted to give myself not just the physical break but also the mental break to give myself the right to play professional cricket. I take a lot of pride in my performance, and I put in a lot of hard work behind the scenes to get my body right for every game. And it has been a pretty tough struggle, given my body is on the wrong side of 30. I think that physical and mental toll probably just wore me down a little bit.\" Maxwell had a similar IPL season in 2020 as well. Playing for Kings XI Punjab then, he managed only 108 runs in 11 innings, at an average of 15.42 and a strike rate of 101.88. He did not hit a single six that year. \"That was probably a different scenario,\" Maxwell said. \"Back then the thing that was hurting me was I was bowling really well. So I was actually playing more as a spinner who was used at the back end [with the bat]. We had KL [Rahul] and Mayank [Agarwal] who were the two leading run-scorers in the competition at that time, so there wasn\\'t a lot of balls left in the game. So I wasn\\'t able to get any match rhythm. And when I was, it was only for a few balls here and there. \"So I said the same thing to the Kings XI management back at the time, that we can have an overseas bowler in my place. But we didn\\'t have an offspinner as well. So I sort of played as an overseas offspinner who could bat a little bit. \"The management here has been outstanding. We\\'ve been working together on taking a fair bit of ownership and the off-field leadership staff is trying to help out as much as they can. Unfortunately, runs just haven\\'t come the way they should have when you are in really good form. I don\\'t think I\\'ve had a better six months in cricket leading into this tournament. So it\\'s frustrating when it ends up like this. But if I can get my body and my mind right, there\\'s no reason I can\\'t finish the tournament well if I do get another opportunity.\"', 'preprocessed_text': 'maxwell take break refresh ask rest rob play glen maxwell elect take break ill refresh physic mental request royal challenge bengaluru manage pick someone el place match sunrise hyderabad maxwell struggle run ill money game score run six inning average specula might sat thumb injury case person pretty easy decks maxwell said rob sixth defeat seven match went far do please coach last game said felt probably time try someone el situate past keep play get deeper hole think actual good time give bit mental physic break get body right require get tournament hope get back really solid mental physic space still impact pretty big deficit straight overplay area strength last couple season felt like contribute posit way bat result posit find table think good time give someone el opportune show ware hope someone make spot come ill maxwell redo form t since start novel run average strike rate period score two under well start ill firstbal duck henna super king since two duck last five ball kolkata knight rider made ball help two drop catch cricket like sometime pretty fickle game said even look first game ran one middle bat keeper pick length really well saw score opportune open face little bit much go well got wide glove get boundary away tournament probably got away simple first game feel made reason good decks still find way get happen cricket snowball like go search try hard forget basic game sri game though turn highscor one bat first sri post secondhighest total cricket rob reply make match play inside glen maxwell battle find form path australia around talk got train go shocker net one day one best next maxwell ask hindsight wish play one game notice overplay pitch slow topic first game said smile realms probably bad game miss would nice bat said want give physic break also mental break give right play profession cricket take lot pride perform put lot hard work behind scene get body right ever game pretty tough struggle given body wrong side think physic mental toll probably wore little bit maxwell similar ill season well play king xi unjam manage run inning average strike rate hit single six year probably differ scenario maxwell said back thing hurt bowl really well actual play spinner use back end bat ka haul yank agar two lead rancor compete time lot ball left game all get match rhythm ball said thing king xi manage back time oversea bowler place offspring well sort play oversea offspring could bat little bit manage outstand work together take fair bit ownership outfield leadership staff try help much unfortun run come way really good form think better six month cricket lead tournament frustrate end like get body mind right reason cannot finish tournament well get azoth opportune', 'len-raw-text': 1035, 'len-preprocessed-text': 462}, {'_id': ObjectId('669e672f0721cfdbc7ef379d'), 'url': '', 'category': 'Sports', 'title': '', 'text': 'Pat Cummins, Nat Sciver-Brunt named as Wisden\\'s Leading Cricketers in the World Pat Cummins is jubilant after leading Australia to victory AFP/Getty Images Pat Cummins and Nat Sciver-Brunt have been named as the Leading Cricketers in the World in the 2024 edition of Wisden Cricketers\\' Almanack, published on Tuesday. Cummins, Australia\\'s fast-bowling spearhead and captain across formats, guided his side to victory over India in both the ICC World Test Championship at The Oval in June, and the 50-over World Cup in Ahmedabad in November. He also oversaw his side\\'s successful defence of the Ashes, in last summer\\'s enthralling 2-2 drawn series in England. He is the first Australian man to be named as Wisden\\'s Leading Cricketer since Michael Clarke in 2012, and succeeds his England counterpart Ben Stokes, who had claimed the honour three times in four years, in 2020, 2021 and 2023. Lawrence Booth, Wisden\\'s editor, said: \"After captaining Australia to success in the World Test Championship, Pat Cummins retained the Ashes - thanks in no small part to his late-order runs in the First Test at Edgbaston - then led Australia to victory in the World Cup final in India. In 2023, no other seamer in world cricket took more than his 42 Test wickets.\" Sciver-Brunt, meanwhile, has been recognised as the pre-eminent women\\'s cricketer of the moment, particularly in light of her starring role in the Women\\'s Ashes, in which she produced back-to-back ODI centuries to take the multi-format series to the wire. She followed those performances with an England-record 66-ball hundred against Sri Lanka, while her global appeal was recognised by Mumbai Indians at the inaugural Women\\'s Premier League auction in February, where her £320,000 price tag made her the UK\\'s best-paid female team athlete. The thrilling nature of both the Men\\'s and Women\\'s Ashes, which were played concurrently in June and July 2023, is reflected in the Anglo-Aussie flavour to Wisden\\'s Five Cricketers of the Year - an honour a player can only win once in their career and which is judged by their performance during the English home season. Three Australians are named among the Five, including the allrounder Ashleigh Gardner, whose 12 wickets in the one-off Women\\'s Test at Trent Bridge were instrumental in her team\\'s retention of the Ashes. She is the tenth female recipient of an honour that dates back to 1889, and the first Australian woman to be named as a Cricketer of the Year since Ellyse Perry in 2020. The other Australians in the Five are Usman Khawaja, the leading run-scorer in the Men\\'s Ashes with 496 runs at 49.60 including a series-defining hundred at Edgbaston, and Mitchell Starc, the leading bowler with 23 wickets at 27.08, who also claimed 16 wickets in the World Cup triumph. Harry Brook, England\\'s break-out star of the 2022-23 winter, is also named alongside Mark Wood, whose selection for the third Test at Headingley last summer was the catalyst for England\\'s stirring fightback in the series. \"Wood turned the Ashes on its head,\" Booth said. \"He topped 96mph, took five for 34, and pushed Australia on the back foot, literally and figuratively. In all, he claimed 14 wickets at just 20 apiece as England came from 2-0 down to square the series.\" Travis Head, meanwhile, has been awarded the Wisden Trophy for the year\\'s best Test performance, following his match-seizing innings of 163 from 174 balls in the World Test Championship final. He succeeds Jonny Bairstow as the second winner of Wisden\\'s newest award, with the trophy having previously been contested during England-West Indies Test series from 1963 to 2020, until it was succeeded by the Richards-Botham Trophy. The other notable award in this year\\'s publication goes to the West Indian Hayley Matthews, who is the first female to be named the Leading Twenty20 Cricketer, after a run of eight consecutive T20I match awards, in which period she averaged 88 with the bat, at a strike-rate of 144, and 12 with the ball. The compelling nature of the Ashes battle is an enduring theme of this year\\'s Almanack, with Booth making the point in his Notes by the Editor that England\\'s ultra-attacking \"Bazball\" approach to the series has already ramped up demand for this summer\\'s Test series against West Indies. \"Amid the gloomy outlook for Test cricket, here was a glimmer of hope: proof that if you put on a show, bums will fill seats,\" he wrote. \"And the 2023 Ashes were a show all right, up there with 1981 and 2005. But for rain in Manchester, it might even have rivalled Australia\\'s Don Bradman-inspired 1936-37 victory, still the only series in Test history won by a team who had trailed 2-0. \"The scoreline was almost secondary. For the first time since English cricket vanished behind a paywall, it felt like the people\\'s sport: Bazball was on their lips and, before long, in the Collins Dictionary.\" Fittingly, the series was capped by the last hurrah of one of the most enduring Ashes competitors of modern times, Stuart Broad, who claimed his 604th and final Test wicket with the last ball of the series to bow out on a high. In his Notes, Booth salutes him as \"England\\'s maker of memories\". \"The best players don\\'t simply rack up the numbers (though his final tally made you tired just thinking of it),\" Booth wrote. \"They leave an impression. Even more than [James] Anderson, Broad was England\\'s maker of memories, the curator of the family album. A rule of thumb emerged: if Broad\\'s knees were pumping, so was England\\'s blood.\" Elsewhere in his Notes, Booth appeals for a reappraisal of the so-called Spirit of Cricket, a concept that came under intense scrutiny following Bairstow\\'s controversial stumping during the Lord\\'s Test, and criticises the game\\'s administrators for undermining the competitive nature of international cricket with an increasingly inequitable split of the ICC\\'s revenues. \"In the era of global television, the West Indians have been hardest hit among the major Test teams,\" Booth wrote. \"India\\'s slice of the pie had grown from less than 25% to 38.5%, or close to $230m a year … West Indies receive 4.58%, or $27.5m. \"Yet this is where cricket finds itself, in dreary thrall to the notion that market forces must be obeyed, while patronising the West Indian game with back-handed compliments, when what it needs is hard cash.

In her report, Gloucestershire\\'s Treasurer Rebecca Watkin insisted that the club\\'s outlook for 2024 and 2025 was more positive, but blamed the current situation on the cost-of-living crisis that has raised the club\\'s day-to-day running costs, allied to the washed-out ODI between England and Ireland in September, which would ordinarily have been a vital source of revenue, given the club\\'s non-Test and Hundred-hosting status. \"This has been a challenging year financially for a number of reasons and there is no doubt it is disappointing to be reporting a second consecutive financial deficit,\" Watkin wrote. \"Gloucestershire has experienced a tumultuous couple of years both on and off the field but despite that, we remain committed to pushing for success on the field with inspiring, competitive cricket, and will ensure all that can be done is done to return improved financial results in the years to come.\" In December, Gloucestershire\\'s board had floated the possibility of selling up the club\\'s historic Nevil Road ground, which has been their home since WG Grace assisted with its purchase in 1889 and could now be worth between £25 and £40 million, and moving to a new out-of-town venue near the junction of the M4 and M5. That prospect could be one step closer now, following an independent audit by chartered accountants, Saffery LLP, which revealed net liabilities of £5,019,000, leaving Gloucestershire in breach of its banking covenants and casting \"significant doubt on the Club\\'s ability to continue as a going concern\". A number of contributory factors were cited in the accounts, including a £67,000 increase in energy bills across four months, and an extra £43,000 in interest-rate payments. The annual £4 million funding that the club receives from the ECB is, Watkin added in her report, effectively worth around £750,000 less in real terms compared to four years ago, while other ventures - including a Ministry of Sound dance party held at the ground in July - \"did not deliver the financial returns predicted\". In his own report, David Jones, the club chair, described the year as a \"rollercoaster\", with Gloucestershire\\'s rock-bottom finish in the 2023 County Championship compounding their off-field struggles. However, with the bidding process now underway for the Women\\'s World Cup in 2026, he insisted the club remained well placed to ensure Bristol retained its status as a host city for such marquee events. On the prospect of the ground relocation, Jones reiterated the club\\'s need to remain \"open-minded\" in spite of the weight of history at the Nevil Ground, adding that the opportunity to relocate to a new, purpose-built and larger site would allow Gloucestershire to \"flourish for future generations\". A formal update on the relocation plans are anticipated in May or June, following further discussions at the club\\'s AGM on April 29.', 'preprocessed_text': 'gloucestershir report million shortfall latest club account heavy rain for abrupt abandon get image gloucestershir viable firstclass count cast renew doubt club report loss million annual account publish money twice shortfall accrue report gloucestershir treasure rebec catkin insist club outlook posit blame current situate costofliv crisis raise club daytoday run cost all washout odd inland ireland septum would ordinarily vital source revenue given club contest hundredhost state challenge year finance number reason doubt disappoint report second connect finance deficit catkin wrote gloucestershir experience tumult couple year field despite remain commit push success field inspire compete cricket ensure done done return improve finance result year come decent gloucestershir board float possible sell club history evil road ground home since we grace assist purchase could worth million move new outoftown menu near junction prospect could one step closer follow indeed audit charter account suffer lap reveal net label leave gloucestershir breach bank coven cast significs doubt club bail continue go concern number contributor factor cite account include increase energy bill across four month extra interest payment annual million fund club receive ebb catkin ad report effect worth around we real term compare four year ago venture include ministry sound dance part held ground puli deli finance return predict report avid one club chair describe year rollercoaster gloucestershir rockbottom finish count championship compound outfield struggle how bid process underway woman world cup insist club remain well place ensure pistol retain state host city marque event prospect ground relic one renter club need remain opening spite weight history evil ground ad opportune relic new purposebuilt larger site would allow gloucestershir flourish future gene formal update relic plan antics may tune follow discus club am aril', 'len-raw-text': 521, 'len-preprocessed-text': 281}, {'_id': ObjectId('669e67480721cfdbc7ef379f'), 'url': '', 'category': 'Sports', 'title': '', 'text': \"Injury-hit Capitals look to throw a wrench into Titans' campaign Rishabh Pant and Jake Fraser-McGurk set up the chase for Delhi Capitals Associated Press Match details Gujarat Titans (GT - 6th; P6 W3 L3) vs Delhi Capitals (DC - 9th; P6 W2 L4) Ahmedabad, 7.30pm IST (2pm GMT) Big picture - Gill's Titans vs Pant's Capitals Just two points separate Gujarat Titans and Delhi Capitals, and yet they are three places apart in the points table. Titans are sixth, and like last year, have won and lost three each out of their first six games. Shubman Gill, their highest run-getter so far, has led them from the front. Another positive for Titans is Rashid Khan returning to form. Rashid had started this IPL with four wickets at 36.25 and an economy of 9.06. But in the last two matches, he has hit back with two wickets at 23, while going at only 5.75 runs an over. What will also please Titans is that Rashid has kept Capitals' captain Rishabh Pant quiet as well. Rashid has allowed Pant only 94 runs off 87 balls across all T20s. But like Gill, Pant has also shown the way for his side even as Capitals are ninth. So far, Pant has 194 runs at a strike rate of 157, having already shown shades of his best with two half-centuries, and some typically funky swipes and swats. Capitals brought their campaign back on track by beating Lucknow Super Giants last week. Jake Fraser-McGurk starred with a fifty in that game, while Kuldeep Yadav, returning from an injury, pushed LSG back with 3 for 20. But Capitals now have injury concerns around David Warner, who was hit on his finger while batting against LSG. Warner is unlikely to start against Titans, who will be wary that things could get interesting heading into the second half of the season if Capitals beat them on Wednesday. Form guide (Last five matches; most recent first) Gujarat Titans WLLWL Delhi Capitals WLLWL Team news and Impact Player strategy Gujarat Titans David Miller, who has missed three games due to a niggle, practiced in the nets two days out from the match. If Miller is available against Capitals, Titans might drop Matthew Wade. The wicketkeeping gloves would, then, go back to Wriddhiman Saha, who sat out of Titans' previous two fixtures due to a back spasm. Saha batted for a lengthy period at practice, while also keeping wicket, thus indicating that he is all but set to start against Capitals. Against Rajasthan Royals, Titans finally picked M Shahrukh Khan after he spent the season on the bench despite being signed for INR 7.4 crore. Coming on as Impact Sub for Mohit Sharma, he smashed 14 from eight balls in what turned out to be a last-ball win for Titans. They could continue to use the same pair, with who replaces whom depending on whether Titans bat or bowl first. Probable XII: 1 Shubman Gill (capt), 2 Wriddhiman Saha (wk), 3 Sai Sudharsan, 4 Vijay Shankar, 5 David Miller, 6 Rahul Tewatia, 7 Rashid Khan, 8 Noor Ahmad, 9 Umesh Yadav, 10 Spencer Johnson, 11 Mohit Sharma, 12 Shahrukh Khan Delhi Capitals It is understood that Warner experienced some swelling and underwent scans upon landing in Ahmedabad. That compounds Capitals' injury issues, after Mitchell Marsh went back to Australia on suffering a partial hamstring tear. If Warner is absent, Capitals might start with Abishek Porel if they bat first and with Jhye Richardson if they chase. Probable XII: 1 Prithvi Shaw, 2 Abishek Porel, 3 Shai Hope, 4 Rishabh Pant (capt & wk), 5 Tristan Stubbs, 6 Axar Patel, 7 Jake Fraser-McGurk, 8 Kuldeep Yadav, 9 Mukesh Kumar, 10 Ishant Sharma, 11 Khaleel Ahmed, 12 Jhye Richardson In the spotlight The top three wicket-takers last IPL were all from Titans. One of them, Mohit Sharma, has had a good time this season too. In the absence of Mohammed Shami and some support from Hardik Pandya, Mohit is Titans' leading wicket-taker this year. His eight wickets have come at 27, although he has been taken for 9.39 runs an over. But when Mohit is bowling in Ahmedabad, the average slides down to 13.03, and the economy to 7.82. So expect Mohit to have an impact with his variations again. Jake Fraser-McGurk turned 22 a day before taking Capitals to a win on his IPL debut, when he clubbed 55 from 35 balls. But he's enjoying some stardom already. Last October, Fraser-McGurk thrashed a List A century off just 29 balls, beating AB de Villiers' record of 31 deliveries. This February, in just his second ODI for Australia, he thumped 41 from only 18 balls against West Indies. With Marsh and Warner missing, Fraser-McGurk can provide just the spark Capitals need to move up the table. Stats that matter Since 2022, only three batters have scored at least 1000 runs in the IPL while averaging 40-plus and striking at above 140. Gill, one of those batters, has been the best across all three metrics. Tristan Stubbs, another of Capitals' in-form batters, has the upper hand over Rashid. Stubbs has faced nine balls from the Titans legspinner in T20s, but has smashed 22 runs off them - including three sixes. Some of Capitals' bowlers will want to be careful in case Miller is fit to play for Titans. Miller has a strike rate of 288 against Ishant Sharma, whom he has smacked for two fours and three sixes in nine deliveries in T20s. Mukesh Kumar, on the other hand, has been pumped for 24 off eight balls. Miller also strikes at 171 and 168 against Khaleel Ahmed and Axar Patel, respectively. Pitch and conditions Ahmedabad saw scores of 168 and 162 batting first in two matches, but that went up to 199 when Titans were playing Punjab Kings. The last two games were won by the chasing team, even as the first one was lost only by six runs. So expect the side winning the toss to bowl first.\", 'preprocessed_text': 'injuryhit capita look throw wrench titan campaign rishabh pant take frasermcgurk set chase deli capita cassock press match detail gujarat titan it the p w l v deli capita dc the p w l ahmedabad am is am get big picture gill titan v pant capita two point spear gujarat titan deli capita yet three place apart point table titan sixth like last year lost three first six game human gill highest pungent far led front azoth posit titan washed khan return form washed start ill four wicket economic last two match hit back two wicket go run also plea titan washed kept capita captain rishabh pant quiet well washed allow pant run ball across t like gill pant also shown way side even capita ninth far pant run strike rate already shown shade best two halfcenturi topic funky swipe swat capita brought campaign back track beat lucknow super giant last week take frasermcgurk star fifth game kuldeep radar return injury push leg back capita injury concern around avid warned hit finger bat leg warned unlike start titan war thing could get interest head second half season capita beat wednesday form guide last five match recent first gujarat titan will deli capita will team news impact player strategy gujarat titan avid miller miss three game due niggle practice net two day match miller avail capita titan might drop matter wade wicketkeeper glove would go back wriddhiman saga sat titan previous two fixture due back spasm saga bat length period practice also keep wicket the indict set start capita rajasthan royal titan final pick shahrukh khan spent season bench despite sign in crore come impact sub most dharma smash eight ball turn astral win titan could continue use pair replace depend whether titan bat bowl first probably xi human gill cat wriddhiman saga we say sudharsan vital hangar avid miller haul tewatia washed khan door ahead mesh radar spencer johns most dharma shahrukh khan deli capita understood warned experience swell under scan upon land ahmedabad compound capita injury issue kitchen marsh went back australia suffer partial hamster tear warned absent capita might start abashed pores bat first the richardson chase probably xi prithee shaw abashed pores shag hope rishabh pant cat we titan stub afar panel take frasermcgurk kuldeep radar makes human island dharma khaleel am the richardson spotlight top three wickettak last ill titan one most dharma good time season absence mom shame support hard panda most titan lead wickettak year eight wicket come although taken run most bowl ahmedabad average slide economic expect most impact variant take frasermcgurk turn day take capita win ill debut club ball enjoy stardom already last doctor frasermcgurk thrash list century ball beat a de sillier record deliver februari second odd australia thump ball west indie marsh warned miss frasermcgurk provide spark capita need move table stay matter since three batter score least run ill average plus strike gill one batter best across three metric titan stub azoth capita inform batter upper hand washed stub face nine ball titan legspinn t smash run include three six capita bowler want care case miller fit play titan miller strike rate island dharma smack two four three six nine deliver t makes human hand pump eight ball miller also strike khaleel am afar panel respect pitch conduit ahmedabad saw score bat first two match went titan play unjam king last two game chase team even first one lost six run expect side win toss bowl first', 'len-raw-text': 1004, 'len-preprocessed-text': 579}, {'_id': ObjectId('669e67500721cfdbc7ef37a0'), 'url': '', 'category': 'Sports', 'title': '', 'text': 'Bayern\\'s season a failure without Champions League title - Kane play Harry Kane has said he is still motivated by proving his critics wrong but admitted Bayern Munich\\'s season will be a failure if they cannot win the Champions League. Bayern host Arsenal in Wednesday\\'s quarterfinal, second leg at the Allianz Arena with the tie evenly poised at 2-2 from last week\\'s first game. - Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.) Kane began his youth career at Arsenal but was released by the club aged nine and has previously spoken about the impact it had on his career, saying it instilled a determination to push himself that contributed to a record of 15 goals in 20 games against the north London club. The 30-year-old became the all-time record goalscorer in north London derbies before leaving Tottenham for Bayern last summer in a deal worth up to €120 million ($128m). When asked at a news conference on Tuesday if he still felt the same determination to prove Arsenal wrong, Kane said: \"I think it was one of the biggest games of the season for pretty much my whole career, we played them at least twice a year for the last 10 years and it was always a big occasion, big moment. \"Maybe it was in the back of the mind, being released from a young age, and there\\'s always a point to prove -- I\\'m the type of player who, throughout my career, has had points to prove along the way. I don\\'t think that ever leaves you. I think it\\'ll always be in my DNA until I retire. \"There\\'ll always be a reason to prove someone wrong or to prove to myself I can do something, so I don\\'t think specifically back to that and think \\'I was released when I was 9 years old, I really have to make a difference tomorrow.\\' \"Now I\\'m here at Bayern Munich it\\'s just about being a top team in the Champions League. Of course I have history with them [Arsenal], but all I can do is try and help Bayern Munich qualify for the semifinal of the Champions League.\" Bayern missed out on the Bundesliga title for the first time in 12 years as Bayer Leverkusen lifted the trophy last weekend and Kane said: \"Of course, from the club\\'s point of view it will be a failed season if we don\\'t win anything this year because we\\'re expected to win, but then all you can do it take that into next year and try to turn that around. \"So I think that\\'s a harsh reality in winning and losing, you can do a lot of good things throughout the year and still end up on the losing side so I don\\'t think it\\'s as harsh as that, there\\'s a lot of things that go into it but I think the main thing for us right now is that we still have an opportunity to turn the season into a great season if we win the Champions League.\" Bayern boss Thomas Tuchel believes his team\\'s greater pedigree in the competition gives them the edge ahead of Wednesday\\'s second leg. Arsenal are playing in the Champions League for the first time in seven years and have not reached the semifinals since 2009. Six-time winners Bayern last won the competition in 2020 but they have lost at the quarterfinal stage in each of the past three seasons. \"I think we have the slight advantage of experience in our team,\" said Tuchel, who lifted the trophy a year later with Chelsea, defeating Manchester City in the final. \"We have players who have won it, we have players who have played decisive matches in this competition. But to make in an advantage, we still have to bring out our very best. \"It can also sometimes be an advantage not to have the experience and have the role as contenders, the role as a hunter. That can be something for Arsenal. To go for it after so many years. \"Also for us it\\'s not so usual for us to be in a semifinal. If you see the last years it\\'s not so easy for us, or anyone, to overcome this stage. Now the situation is here that we have one decisive match to make the next big step in this beautiful competition. \"We are determined to bring everything to the table. If the experience within our group brings us an extra 5% we are happy to bring it to the table. \"But we have to bring it. Nobody will give us anything. It\\'s like this in this competition.

(2:20) A 6-0 win -- including a four-goal night by one of his star players in Cole Palmer -- should have left Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino with no issues following the game. But that was far from the case, as the Argentine coach took his team to task for an incident regarding who would take a penalty kick in the second half with Chelsea already up 4-0 on Everton on Monday night at Stamford Bridge. - Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.) Captain Conor Gallagher had to intervene to shove away Nicolas Jackson and Noni Madueke as they squabbled for the ball after the latter was brought down in the box. Gallagher secured the ball then handed it to Palmer, the team\\'s designated penalty taker. \"The players and staff know that Cole Palmer is the penalty taker,\" said a furious Pochettino after the game. \"I am so, so upset about the situation. Discipline is the most important thing in our team. \"We all agree they [Jackson and Madueke] were wrong. They are not experienced players. They are young. It was very good the reaction by Conor Gallagher [to defuse things].\" \"We can\\'t show that type of behaviour,\" he continued. \"It\\'s like we are in a school, and our job is to show them they were wrong so they can learn.

We need to change and think more in a collective way. \"I thought we behaved like kids today. When this happens, we need to learn and learn quick. Perform like today but behave much better.\" The result keeps Chelsea in ninth place on 47 points but only trailing the teams in front of them by three and with games in hand as they look to move up the table before the season finale on May 19.

Shi Tang/Getty Images The BWF Swiss Open kicks off the final 40 days of the qualification window that the Badminton World Federation [BWF] have set out for the Paris Olympics, and battles for a ticket to the big one are gaining pace now. The window, which started on May 1, 2023 will close on April 28, 2024. Before we proceed, though, a reminder of how many athletes will go to Paris -- 35 athletes each in the two singles events. If two athletes from the same country have to qualify, they both must be in the top 16 of the BWF Race to Paris (RTP) rankings by the end of April. Meanwhile, the list is shorter for doubles, with 16 teams each going to Paris across the three doubles disciplines. Only two teams per country are allowed, and that is only if the two teams are ranked in the top 8 of the RTP. We look at India's prospects discipline-wise, and with a sharper context of the upcoming BWF Swiss Open 2024 in mind: Men's Singles HS Prannoy's ticket to Paris is already booked, so his decision to take time off and focus on physical recovery makes sense. It's the second spot, though, where it gets tricky. Lakshya Sen is in the top 16, just. Ranked RTP #15 after two stunning runs to the semifinals in the French Open and All England Championship, he needs to keep his new-found momentum to stay within the qualification zone. The next closest Indian is Kidambi Srikanth, who's RTP #26. He needs to go on a strong run, starting at the Swiss Open, to seriously challenge for a spot. In Basel, Lakshya will start against Leon Jun Hao of Malaysia before a potential second-round match against the in-form Frenchman Christo Popov. Win that, and he could be in for a potential quarter against top-seed Lee Zii Jia (or Srikanth). Srikanth starts against Wang Tzu Wei before a likely second-round clash against LZJ. There's more Indian interest, though, with Priyanshu Rajawat (RTP #32) taking on fourth seed Lee Cheuk Yiu of Hong Kong and Kiran George (RTP #35) taking on Takuma Obayashi of Japan in the opening round. Women's Singles PV Sindhu is currently RTP #13 and with the next Indian ranked #40 (Aakarshi Kashyap), she should have a straightforward march to Paris. But after having shown glimpses of returning to her old self in Paris and Birmingham over the past fortnight, she'll want a deep run in Basel to keep that mojo going. Seeded fourth, she starts off with a clash against Yvonne Li (who retired hurt against Sindhu last week at All England). A win there and Japan's Tomoko Miyazaki awaits... but a tougher test would be in the quarters where she takes on Paris-chasing Aya Ohori (RTP #11, second-highest Japanese player, seven places below Akane Yamaguchi and just six above Nozomi Okuhara) or Paris-chasing Busanan Ongbamrungphan (RTP #20, one place below Pornapawee Chochuwong and six below Ratchanok Intanon) Aakarshi, meanwhile, starts with a tough draw against Michelle Li. Win that and one of Okuhara or Intanon await her in the second round. Men's Doubles World no. 1 Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty are RTP #2 and have their Paris berths sealed. They, like HSP, are skipping this tournament to focus on recovery. With that, there will be no Indian presence in MD at Basel. Path to Paris: After historic 2023, 'hungry' Sat-Chi embrace pressure, master the mind games Women's Doubles This here is a two-way battle between Tanisha Crasto-Ashwini Ponnappa (RTP #20) and Treesa Jolly-Gayatri Gopichand (RTP #26) to see who'll go. With only a max of two teams per country allowed, it is almost a certainty that whoever of Ash-Tan and Gaya-Tree finish the RTP higher will go to Paris. (For instance, China have five teams in the top 20, Japan have another five, South Korea have three). Ash-Tan begin their campaign against Rose-Puspitasari of Indonesia before a potential second-round match against Japan's Hirokami-Kato (RTP #30). On paper, the draw gives them a relatively straightforward run to the semis where they're likely to face top seeds (RTP #9) Rahayu-Ramadhanti of Indonesia. Incidentally, the top seeds get going against another Indian pair, the Panda sisters Rutuparna and Swetaparna (#48 in RTP). Gaya-Tree are on the other side of the draw and start against Annie and Kerry Xu of the USA, before a possible second-round meeting with compatriots Priya Konjengbam and Shruti Mishra (RTP #75). Their side of the draw is stacked with Paris-chasing Kusuma-Pratiwi (RTP #18, second-highest ranked Indonesian pair) a potential quarterfinal opponent and Denmark's Fruergaard-Thygsen (RTP #22) or Nakanishi-Iwanaga (RTP #12, fourth highest ranked Japanese team) potential semifinal opponents. Women's doubles is the most heavily represented event for Indians in Basel, with Ashwini Bhat - Shikha Gautam (RTP #59) making it five Indian pairs. Bhat-Gautam have a tough opener, taking on RTP #17 Yeung-Yeung of Hong Kong. Mixed Doubles There's no Indian participation at the Swiss Open, and there's next to no chance there will be Indian participation at the Olympics in this event - the highest ranked Indians are Satish Karunakaran and Aadya Variyath, and they're #44 in the RTP.\", 'preprocessed_text': \"swims open lakshya lead india counting chase lamp qualify spot lakshya see action of world championship copenhagen denmark she tanggetti image of swims open kick final day qualify window badminton world fever of set part lamp battle ticket big one gain pace window start may close aril proceed though remind man athlete go part athlete two single event two athlete country qualify must top of race part rip rank end aril meanwhile list shorter doubt team go part across three doubt discipline two team per country allow two team rank top rip look india prospect disciplines sharper context upon of swims open mind men single h annoy ticket part already book decks take time focus physic recover make see second spot though get trick lakshya see top rank rip two stun run semifinal french open inland championship need keep newfound momentum stay within qualify zone next closest india iambi srikanth rip need go strong run start swims open serious challenge spot based lakshya start lean jun had malaysia potent secondround match inform freshman christy poor win could potent quarter tops lee zip via srikanth srikanth start want tau we like secondround clash let india interest though priyanshu rajawat rip take fourth seed lee check you hong long iran glory rip take trauma obayashi japan open round woman single pa sadhu current rip next india rank aakarshi kasha straightforward march part shown glimpse return old self part birmingham past fortnight want deep run based keep mojo go seed fourth start clash yon li retire hurt sadhu last week inland win japan took miyazaki await tougher test would quarter take parishes ya short rip secondhighest japan's player seven place aka yamaguchi six nozomi okuhara parishes bushman ongbamrungphan rip one place pornapawe chochuwong six ratchanok intanon aakarshi meanwhile start tough draw nickel li win one okuhara intanon await second round men doubt world satwiksairaj rankireddi chiral shitty rip part berth seal like hop skip tournament focus recover india present my based path part history hungry watch embrace pressure master mind game woman doubt today battle vanish crastoashwini ponnappa rip trees jollygayatri gopichand rip see go man two team per country allow almost certainty whoever ashcan gayatre finish rip higher go part instant china five team top japan azoth five south korea three ashcan begin campaign rosepuspitasari indonesia potent secondround match japan hirokamikato rip paper draw give real straightforward run semi like face top seed rip rahayuramadhanti indonesia incident top seed get go azoth india pair panda sister rutuparna swetaparna rip gayatre side draw start anna merry xu us possible secondround meet compatriot price konjengbam sruti misery rip side draw stack parishes kusumapratiwi rip secondhighest rank indonesia pair potent quartering open denmark fruergaardthygsen rip nakanishiiwanaga rip fourth highest rank japan's team potent semifinal open woman doubt heavily repress event india based ashing that shiksa bantam rip make five india pair bhatgautam tough open take rip yeungyeung hong long mix doubt india particle swims open next chance india particle lamp event highest rank india latish karunakaran lady variate rip\", 'len-raw-text': 885, 'len-preprocessed-text': 504}, {'_id': ObjectId('669e67940721cfdbc7ef37a6'), 'url': '', 'category': 'Sports', 'title': '', 'text': \"2024 All England Championships takeaways: Lakshya's resurgence, Sindhu's positives, Sat-Chi's warning A return to basics has resulted in Lakshya Sen's uptick in form - with the Paris Olympics looming closer. Shi Tang/Getty Images Another All England Championship has come and gone and India's wait for another title at the oldest badminton tournament continues. 2024 had seemed a good chance to end the drought: especially with men's doubles top seeds Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty in red-hot form. However, they went out in the second round, as did PV Sindhu. Lakshya Sen, who reached the semifinals after a couple of stunning wins, was the last Indian standing while fellow men's singles players all lost in the first round. Here's a look at the takeaways for Indian badminton from 2024 All England, and what it means for the season ahead with the end of Paris Olympics qualifications on the horizon: Lakshya Sen rises again This All England marked a full circle, or rather, a triangle for Lakshya. Two years after his breakthrough, reaching the final of the 2022 edition, and two months after his lowest point on tour after seven straight first-round exits, Lakshya appears to have found his mojo back with two back-to-back semifinals. In Birmingham, he did a full 2022 throwback, beating world No 3 Anders Antonsen and 2021 champion Lee Zii Jia in tough three-game battles that brought out the best of his game - quick-footed and counterpunching, with the much-needed added element of composure. That he went down to Jonatan Christie in the semis may seem like a missed opportunity in an open field, but the 22-year-old has accomplished the much tougher task of overturning a mental slump. A deep run at a prestigious Super 1000 where the best players in the world struggled validates what his childhood coaches Vimal Kumar has been saying - physically his game was all there, it was a matter of confidence. The best part of this run is that the bounce was back in his step - he played a clean game with very good body language, something that had deserted him during his low period. This would have been the shot in the arm he needed, both for his game and his place in the race to Paris Olympics. Currently 15th in the BWF Race to Paris rankings, he needs to remain in the top 16 to qualify. Satwik-Chirag and men's doubles minefield The biggest upset from an Indian perspective was Satwik and Chirag losing in the second round in straight games. Muhammad Fikri and Bagas Maulana beat them 16-21, 15-21 to end their 5-match winning streak as well as their four-final run, playing a tactically smart game from the front court to outfox them. It wasn't a terrible result, though. They may have been the top seeds, but they lost to the 2022 All England champions, who then lost in the next round to the former world champions Soh-Chia. Meanwhile, the reigning world champions Seo-Kang lost in the first round and the second seeds Liang-Wang were also knocked out in the second round, by the reigning Olympic champions Lee-Wang. Simply put - this situation is reflective of the current men's doubles landscape, which has become increasingly competitive in the last couple of years and any pair can beat the other on their day. This in turn automatically makes player performance look more erratic that it is. Right now, there is not much to read into Satwik-Chirag's All England run except that they missed a major goal of 2024 - to reach the final of the Super 1000 they never have before. However, nothing motivates Satiwk-Chirag more than losses and this can add fuel to their fire in an important season. Sindhu has positives to count On paper, Sindhu had one walkover and lost the next match in Birmingham. On court, though, the second-round loss (19-21, 11-21) to world No 1 An Se Young is more than just an early exit. Yes, this was her seventh straight loss to the South Korean but it's a loss to take some heart from. Like in her loss to Olympic champion Chen Yu Fei at the French Open, Sindhu showed glimpses of her vintage self. She was quick on her feet, tactically more aware and played some brilliant shots to fight back and put herself in a good position against a tough opponent. This is more than she was able to throughout 2023, when she was coming back from a five-month injury layoff. Her comeback from the latest fourth-month injury layoff in February has started much better. Building up to the Paris Olympics, Sindhu raising hopes of returning to her pre-2022 surgery phase is one of the best takeaways for Indian badminton. What do we make of Prannoy's blip? HS Prannoy, who had the best year of his career in 2023, has been the only seeded Indian in singles for a while now by virtue of his consistency. In fact, he has already mathematically qualified for the Paris Olympics - his first ever - because of his steady run. However, the world no 8 has now lost three straight first-round matches on the BWF Tour, the last two to unheralded players. He reached the semifinal of the India Open Super 750 in January and won only one of three matches at the Badminton Asia Team Championship in February. It is too early to state if this a cause for concern and he himself must be disappointed with his loss -- having shared that his father has travelled to watch him at All England for the first time. He has not entered the next to BWF Super 300 events in Europe either, likely in an attempt at managing his fitness. Prannoy's form, though, is something to keep an eye on as the season progresses. The all-Indian women's doubles battle In women's doubles, there is an interesting battle brewing between Treesa Jolly and Gayatri Gopichand - who were the India No 1 pair for a long time before injury concerns pulled them behind in 2023 - and Tanisha Crasto and Ashwini Ponnappa, a newer pair who climbed up the ranks with a good end to 2023 - for the Paris Olympics qualification spot. This adds another layer to all their BWF World Tour performances. Currently, they are neck-to-neck at world No 22 and 23 in the world respectively but Tanisha-Ashwini are a little ahead at 11 to the other's 14 in the Olympics race. The top 16 spots usually qualify for the Olympics. At All England, Treesa and Gayatri lost in the first round, ending their streak of two straight semifinals, which will affect their points. Ashwini and Tanisha, meanwhile, beat a higher ranked pair and reached the second round of the Super 1000, which will give them a big boost. The cut-off is at the end of April, and this adds more intrigue to the Indian results in women's doubles.\", 'preprocessed_text': 'inland championship takeaway lakshya resurge sadhu posit watch warn return basic result lakshya see uptick form part lamp loom closer she tanggetti image azoth inland championship come gone india wait azoth till oldest badminton tournament continue seem good chance end drought expect men doubt top seed satwiksairaj rankireddi chiral shitty redo form how went second round pa sadhu lakshya see reach semifinal couple stun win last india stand fellow men single player lost first round look takeaway india badminton inland mean season ahead end part lamp qualify horizon lakshya see rise inland mark full circle rather triangle lakshya two year breakthrough reach final edit two month lowest point tour seven straight firstround exit lakshya appear found mojo back two backtrack semifinal birmingham full throwback beat world under antonsen champion lee zip via tough threegam battle brought best game quickfoot counterpunch muchness ad element composer went sonata christy semi may seem like miss opportune open field yearly accomplish much tougher task overturn mental slump deep run prestige super best player world struggle valid childhood coach vital human say physic game matter confide best part run bound back step play clean game good body language some desert low period would shot arm need game place race part lamp current the of race part rank need remain top qualify satwikchirag men doubt minefield biggest upset india perfect satin chiral lose second round straight game muhammad fire bag mauling beat end match win streak well fourgon run play tactic smart game front court outfox terrible result though may top seed lost inland champion lost next round former world champion lochia meanwhile reign world champion smoking lost first round second seed liangwang also knock second round reign lamp champion leeway simple put situate reflect current men doubt landscape become increasingly compete last couple year pair beat day turn automat make player perform look errant right much read satwikchirag inland run except miss major goal reach final super never how not motive satiwkchirag loss add fuel fire import season sadhu posit count paper sadhu one walk lost next match birmingham court though secondround loss world we young early exit ye seventh straight loss south korea loss take heart like loss lamp champion when you few french open sadhu show glimpse vintage self quick foot tactic away play brilliant shot fight back put good posit tough open all throughout come back fivemonth injury layoff comeback latest fourthmonth injury layoff februari start much better build part lamp sadhu raise hope return are surgery phase one best takeaway india badminton make annoy blip h annoy best year career seed india single virtu consist fact already mathematic qualify part lamp first ever steady run how world lost three straight firstround match of tour last two unheard player reach semifinal india open super jaguar one three match badminton aria team championship februari early state concern must disappoint loss share father travel watch inland first time enter next of super event euros either like attempt manage fit annoy form though some keep eye season progress allindian woman doubt battle woman doubt interest battle brew trees jolly gayatri gopichand india pair long time injury concern pull behind vanish cast ashing ponnappa newer pair climb rank good end part lamp qualify spot add azoth layer of world tour perform current necktoneck world world respect tanishaashwini little ahead other lamp race top spot usual qualify lamp inland trees gayatri lost first round end streak two straight semifinal affect point ashing vanish meanwhile beat higher rank pair reach second round super give big boost cutoff end aril add intrigue india result woman doubt', 'len-raw-text': 1155, 'len-preprocessed-text': 597}, {'_id': ObjectId('669e679c0721cfdbc7ef37a7'), 'url': '', 'category': 'Sports', 'title': '', 'text': 'Jonatan Christie beats Lakshya Sen in three-game thriller, sets up All Indonesian final at 2024 All England Championships Jonatan Christie of Indonesia celebrates after winning the Men\\'s Singles Semi Final against Lakshya Sen of India at the All England Open Badminton Championships 2024 Catherine Ivill/Getty Images The All England Championships will see an All Indonesian men\\'s final in 2024 after Jonatan Christie beat India\\'s Lakshya Sen 21-12, 10-21, 21-15 to join Anthony Ginting (who beat France\\'s Christo Popov 19-21, 21-5, 21-11) in the title clash. In the second men\\'s semi of the day, Christie started rapidly.. flying out of the blocks. spraying his trademark jump smashes across Lakshya\\'s court (and body). It was close in the early stages, 6-6 as Lakshya kept up pace with the furious shot-making with some superb smashes of his own, but after opening up a four point lead at the mid-game break (11-7), Christie didn\\'t really look back. Some delightful touches at the net and those smashes directed at the body kept Lakshya guessing and there was little he could do as he closed the game out with the first of his eight game points, taking it 21-12. The second started similarly with a quick exchange of points but 3-2 for Lakshya became 6-3 and then Christie completely broke down. All his smashes went well wide, his drops found the net or drifted out of bounds, even his regulation clears were wayward. Those that remain inbounds were dispatched superbly by the alert Lakshya and from 6-3, he took an incredible 17-4 lead. A mini rally for Christie got him six more points but by then Lakshya had also drawn away, and he closed out the game 21-10. Considering how near-perfect Christie had been in the first game, this was a strange, sudden reversal that Lakshya took the utmost advantage of. Ahead of the third game, the great Prakash Padukone, travelling with Lakshya (and PV Sindhu), was heard giving him some advice: \"[Christie] will come out fast early on, you have to be prepared for it\". And prepared he was as he went 2-0 up, and then 5-3 up... by now he was controlling the pace and intensity of the rallies and relying on a combination of his patience and Christie\\'s wayward aggression to seize control of the game. Said control was short lived though as Christie changed up tactics to make it 6-6. He let go of the early smash-to-kill strategy that had won him the first game and lost him the second and adopted a more a patient approach, trusting his defence to open up gaps in Lakshya\\'s armour. By the time 7-7 became 8-8 and then 10-8 in favour of Christie, he knew he had the upper hand. Going into the decisive mid-game break 11-9 up, he opened up his full array of strokes again -- one in particular, where he leaned back and hit an overhand inside-out smash that flew down the line at an angle that Lakshya neither predicted nor could do anything about. That smash made it 16-12 for Christie and from there it was routine as he made it 20-12. Despite Lakshya\\'s late resistance saving three of those eight match points, Christie closed it out with a delicious drop angled cross-court. Lakshya\\'s loss, meanwhile, meant that was the end of India\\'s participation in Birmingham.

Catherine Ivill/Getty Images Two months ago, Lakshya Sen was mired in a terrible slump, looking lost after seven straight first-round exits on the BWF Tour. Today, Lakshya Sen has reached back-to-back semifinals in two straight weeks of the BWF Tour - at a Super 750 and Super 1000 tournament (the two highest tiers) looking supremely confident against some of the best players in the world. The 22-year-old Indian made the semis at the prestigious All England Championships after stunning comeback wins against world No. 3 Anders Antonsen and 2021 champion Lee Zii Jia in the span of two days. Against the Dane, he came back from a poor second game and 2-8 down in the decider to grab the final 8 points in his 24-22, 11-21, 21-14 win. Against the Malaysian, he fought back from a game down to win 20-22, 21-16, 21-19. The scoreline margins indicate how the final phase was a test of nerves as much as skill. Both times, he was the underdog and under pressure, both times he emerged victorious by being calm and playing his own game. Follow LIVE: Lakshya Sen vs Jonatan Christie The unseeded Indian showed the full range of his counter-punching prowess and speedy court-work, this time underlined by an exceptionally composed demeanour that has piled the pressure on his opponents as much as his skillful defence. He did that in Paris last week - where all his wins came from a game down - and he has backed it up in Birmingham, with the presence of childhood coaches Prakash Padukone and Vimal Kumar on the bench behind him. It's a complete U-turn and it's come at the best time possible - with the Paris Olympics looming closer. This Lakshya looks nothing like the dejected player at the India Open in January, plainly admitting that he was yet to process his latest loss to even think of the future. This Lakshya looked more like the 20-year-old breaking through the ranks back in 2022, reaching the final of All-England; beating Antonsen and Lee then as well. How did he turn it all around? In New Delhi, Vimal Kumar spoke about how Lakshya's issues were more mental than physical. His collapses stemmed from a lack of confidence rather than a technical glitch. The best way to solve them, the coach believed, was to not overthink but go back to his basics and put together a few wins. DIY: How childhood coach Vimal Kumar hopes Lakshya Sen can get his mojo back Conquering mental opponents is easier said than done but Lakshya has apparently managed to do just that. He is not only sticking to his basics of a quick, counter-punching game which can easily transition into attack when the opportunity arises, but he is doing it with complete confidence and composure. The 22-year-old did this multiple times against Lee, keeping the rallies on his racquet and forcing his opponent to do something extra while he remained steady. Lakshya was leading 8-3 to start the match before Lee reduced it to 9-8 and then levelled things at 12-12 and 16-16. They were battling it out in versatile rallies and smashed winners, with Lee often overhitting and Lakshya anticipating the errors. It was Lee who had three game points but Lakshya saved them all with great shots under pressure. On his fourth, he converted when Lakshya hit long - reiterating that the points were more often decided by the Indian's actions. The way Lee took the first game where Lakshya looked like the better player is a testament to the Malaysian's talent. Later however, the erratic tag that often describes him proved to be the difference. Lakshya, in the second game, stayed consistent and once again had the lead at the interval with more varied retrieving. The second half, however, was much closer with very small margins. Lee, looking to be the one to end points, committed a bunch of errors and got more cautious while Lakshya used the chance to force more mishits and eventually a decider. The Indian varied his pace and shots well to take charge of points. The decider was much tighter with no real lead to either player. But where Lee was sharp at the net and nailing smashes sporadically, Lakshya was constantly directing shots all over the court and had the interval lead once again as well as the momentum. The second half was not the cleanest of games but Lakshya's patience while Lee looked worried was a key difference. There was a superb rally at 13-16 where Lakshya won with his variety and smarts, a dogged defence ending with a smashed winner. Lee Zii Jia ���� competes against Lakshya Sen ���� in a hard-fought matchup.#BWFWorldTour #AllEngland2024 pic.twitter.com/wFqMCJh8G1 - BWF (@bwfmedia) March 16, 2024 But just as the Indian saw the finish line at 18-14, came the final twist as Lee levelled things at 19-19 with a cracking angled smash after a brief medical check for his arm. It was the moment of truth for Lakshya and those final 2 points went back to what coach Kumar had said so long ago. Lakshya forced Lee to mishit with quick parrying and then Lee pushed his return long, as he had so often in the match. Lakshya stuck to his basics and found confidence to reach the All-England semis once again - a full circle of sorts. Two years after his breakthrough and two months after his lowest point, Lakshya Sen discovered, or rather rediscovered, the core of what made him stand out as a badminton player. Next, he faces Jonathan Christie, whom he trails 1-2 in their head-to-head, for a place in the final. If he can continue playing his newfound old game, Lakshya can find something as precious at the oldest badminton tournament in the world.\", 'preprocessed_text': 'lakshya see reach allengland semifinal return basic lakshya see celebs win quartering lee zip via inland badminton championship gathering ivillgetti image two month ago lakshya see mire terrible slump look lost seven straight firstround exit of tour today lakshya see reach backtrack semifinal two straight week of tour super super tournament two highest tier look supreme confide best player world yearly india made semi prestige inland championship stun comeback win world under antonsen champion lee zip via span two day done came back poor second game decide grab final point win malaysia fought back game win scoreline margin indict final phase test nerve much skill time underdog pressure time emerge victory calm play game follow live lakshya see v sonata christy unseen india show full rang counterpunch prowess speed coursework time underline except compose demeanor pile pressure open much skill defend part last week win came game back birmingham present childhood coach rakish padukon vital human bench behind complete outrun come best time possible part lamp loom closer lakshya look not like deject player india open jaguar plainly admit yet process latest loss even think future lakshya look like yearly break rank back reach final allengland beat antonsen lee well turn around new deli vital human spoke lakshya issue mental physic collapse stem lack confide rather technic glitch best way sold coach believe overshine go back basic put together win did childhood coach vital human hope lakshya see get mojo back conquer mental open easier said done lakshya appear manage stick basic quick counterpunch game easily transit attack opportune arms complete confide composer yearly multiple time lee keep rally racquet for open some extra remain steady lakshya lead start match lee reduce level thing battle versatile rally smash winner lee often overdid lakshya antics error lee three game point lakshya save great shot pressure fourth convert lakshya hit long renter point often decide india action way lee took first game lakshya look like better player testament malaysia talent later how errant tag often describe prove differ lakshya second game stay consist lead intern vary retrieve second half how much closer small margin lee look one end point commit bunch error got caution lakshya use chance for mishit event decide india vary pace shot well take charge point decide much tighter real lead either player lee sharp net nail smash spored lakshya constantly direct shot court intern lead well momentum second half cleanest game lakshya patient lee look worry key differ superb rally lakshya variety smart dog defend end smash winner lee zip via compete lakshya see hardfought matchupbwfworldtour allengland pictwittercomwfqmcjhg of bwfmedia march india saw finish line came final twist lee level thing crack angel smash brief medic check arm moment truth lakshya final point went back coach human said long ago lakshya for lee mishit quick parry lee push return long often match lakshya stuck basic found confide reach allengland semi full circle sort two year breakthrough two month lowest point lakshya see disco rather rediscover core made stand badminton player next face jonathan christy trail headtohead place final continue play newfound old game lakshya find some precious oldest badminton tournament world', 'len-raw-text': 994, 'len-preprocessed-text': 523}, {'_id': ObjectId('669e67c20721cfdbc7ef37a9'), 'url': '', 'category': 'Sports', 'title': '', 'text': 'Sat-Chi and Sindhu headline India\\'s push to end drought at All England Championship File photo of Satwik and Chirag Photo by How Foo Yeen/Getty Images The All England Championship, long seen as badminton\\'s traditional holy grail - even after introduction of the World Championship and Olympic inclusion - holds a special significance in Indian badminton. Only two Indians have ever won the All England trophy - Prakash Padukone in 1980 and Pullela Gopichand in 2001. Incidentally, both will be at the 2024 edition, which starts on Tuesday in Birmingham, on the coach\\'s chair. Padukone has been travelling on tour since last week\\'s French Open Super 750, coaching PV Sindhu and Lakshya Sen, while Gopichand is the national coach with almost all other players. But it\\'s not just their presence that raises hope of that drought ending this year; it\\'s the performance of the world No 1 pair - Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty. Fresh from their dominant French Open title run on Sunday and having reached the final of all the BWF events they have played so far in 2024, the men\\'s doubles pair are overwhelming favourites for another first in Indian badminton. Being a Super 1000 tournament, the All England also offers a chance for crucial points in the Olympic qualification race and a chance to build on the momentum from Paris, where four Indians reached the quarterfinals. The draws in Birmingham are admittedly tough for most Indians and playing for the second straight week will need them to be at their best. Here\\'s a look at the Indian\\'s draw and chances at All England 2024: Men\\'s Doubles Satwiksairaj Rankireddy & Chirag Shetty vs Mohammad Ahsan & Hendra Setiawan Let\\'s switch things around and start with the discipline all eyes will be on to end India\\'s All England title drought. At the start of the year, Chirag had called this title one their 2024 goals: \"...that there are a couple of Super 1000s we haven\\'t medalled at, the All England is one major tournament we have not played a final yet.\" The path to the final, though, won\\'t be without big challenges. The top seeds face an interesting first-round battle - against the \\'Daddies\\', Mohammad Ahsan and Hendra Setiawan, who lead the Indians 4-3 and had beaten them the last time they played. In a way, this is a clash between the past and present of men\\'s doubles badminton as the Indonesian three-time world champions are 36 and 39 years of age, now unseeded against the most consistent pair of 2024. If Satwik and Chirag pass this early test, they could play 2022 champions Muhammad Shohibul Fikri and Bagas Maulana in the second round and former nemeses Aaron Chia and Soh Wooi Yik in the quarters. Men\\'s doubles is a highly competitive space and the Indians have been the best at this year, reaching the finals of all the Super 1000 and Super 750 events so far. Fresh off a title and a target to achieve, it\\'ll be hard not to see them as the favourites. Women\\'s Singles PV Sindhu vs Yvonne Li Aakarshi Kashyap vs Pai Yu-po Another Indian star who is yet to reach the final of All England is PV Sindhu. The former world champion has made a solid return from the injury layoff and was playing close to her best last week at the French Open, where she lost to reigning Olympic champion Chen Yu Fei in a very close quarterfinal. In Birmingham, she starts against Germany\\'s Yvonne Li, against whom she has a 2-0 record. But the real challenge comes early with a potential clash against world No 1 and defending champion An Se Young, whom she has never beaten before. Can the seventh time be the charm? Also in action will be Akarshi Kahsyap, who plays Pai Yu Po in the first round with a possible clash against eighth seed Han Yue if she reached the second. Men\\'s Singles HS Prannoy vs Su Li-yang Lakshya Sen vs Ng Tze Yong Srikanth Kidambi vs Viktor Axelsen Priyanshu Rajawat vs Chico Aura Dwi Wardoyo Lakshya, who rediscovered his touch with an impressive run to the semifinal last week, is the 2022 runner-up at All England and would want to build on his newly found momentum. He is slated to play Ng Tze Yong, who he has a solid 4-0 record against, but the Malaysian could withdraw. He faces a potential tricky second round against fourth seed Anders Antonsen. HS Prannoy, the only seeded Indian in singles, faced a first-round exit at the French Open to Lu Guang Zu, and will be keen to get going this week. He starts against Chinese Taipei\\'s Su Li-yang in what will be their first meeting. The other seed in his quarter is Li Shi Feng, who lost to Lakshya last week. Srikanth, who beat Chou Tien Chen but lost to Lu last week, has the most difficult draw on paper - facing top seed Viktor Axelsen. However, Axelsen has not been his formidable self this season and lost in the second round in Paris. If Srikanth has to make a big push for points, this is the time to upset the Dane who leads him 10-3. Priyanshu Rajawat starts against Chico Aura Dwi Wardoyo, who reached the semis in Paris and has beaten the Indian in their only meeting. A win will put him on collision course with second seed and French Open champion Shi Yu Qi. Women\\'s Doubles Treesa Jolly & Gayatri Gopichand vs Apriyani Rahayu & Siti Fadia Silva Ramadhanti Tanisha Crasto & Ashwini Ponnappa vs Yeung Nga Ting & Yeung Pui Lam Swetaparna Panda & Rutaparna Panda vs Rin Iwanaga & Kie Nakanishi Treesa Jolly and Gayatri Gopichand, still on the comeback trail after missing a large chunk of the last season, have had their best results on tour at the All England - reaching the semis in the last two editions. Looking for Olympic qualification, the 20-year-old will hope for a hattrick of deep runs. But a very tough draw awaits them, starting with Indonesian combination of Apriyani Rahayu and Siti Fadia Silva Ramadhanti who lead them 2-0. A win will pit them against eighth seeds Mayu Matsumoto and Wakana Nagahara while the inevitable world No 1 pair of Chen Qing Chen and Jia Yi Fan await in their quarter. The other women\\'s doubles pair of Tanisha Crasto and Ashwini Ponnappa, also looking for Olympic qualification, play Hong Kong\\'s Yeung Nga Ting and Yeung Pui Lam. The Indians beat them at the Badminton Asia Championship last month and will likely play fifth seeds Zhang Shu Xian and Zheng Yu if they win again. The Panda sisters, Rutaparna and Swetaparna, have also made the cut and start against Rin Iwanaga and Kie Nakanishi of Japan in what is their first meeting. A win means a second-round clash against second seeds Baek Ha Na and Lee So Hee.', 'preprocessed_text': 'watch sadhu headline india push end drought inland championship file photo satin chiral photo for yeengetti image inland championship long seen badminton trait hold grail even introduce world championship lamp incus hold special significs india badminton two india ever inland trophy rakish padukon pulled gopichand incident edit start tuesday birmingham coach chair padukon travel tour since last week french open super coach pa sadhu lakshya see gopichand nation coach almost player present raise hope drought end year perform world pair satwiksairaj rankireddi chiral shitty fresh domain french open till run sundae reach final of event play far men doubt pair overwhelm favorite azoth first india badminton super tournament inland also offer chance crucial point lamp qualify race chance build momentum part four india reach quartering draw birmingham admittedly tough india play second straight week need best look india draw chance inland men doubt satwiksairaj rankireddi chiral shitty v mohammad than henry setiawan let u switch thing around start discipline eye end india inland till drought start year chiral call till one goal couple super medal inland one major tournament play final yet path final though without big challenge top seed face interest firstround battle daddy mohammad than henry setiawan lead india beaten last time play way clash past present men doubt badminton indonesia threetim world champion year age unseen consist pair satin chiral pas early test could play champion muhammad shohibul fire bag mauling second round former names baron chip soh wood yin quarter men doubt highly compete space india best year reach final super super event far fresh till target achieve hard see favorite woman single pa sadhu v yon li aakarshi kasha v pay yup azoth india star yet reach final inland pa sadhu former world champion made solid return injury layoff play close best last week french open lost reign lamp champion when you few close quartering birmingham start german yon li record real challenge come early potent clash world defend champion we young never beaten seventh time charm also action akarshi kahsyap play pay you to first round possible clash eighth seed can due reach second men single h annoy v so living lakshya see v no the long srikanth iambi v victor axelsen priyanshu rajawat v chico aura i arroyo lakshya rediscover touch impress run semifinal last week runner inland would want build newly found momentum slate play no the long solid record malaysia could withdraw face potent trick second round fourth seed under antonsen h annoy seed india single face firstround exit french open la gang u keen get go week start chine tape so living first meet seed quarter li she fend lost lakshya last week srikanth beat chou then when lost la last week difficult draw paper face top seed victor axelsen how axelsen formed self season lost second round part srikanth make big push point time upset done lead priyanshu rajawat start chico aura i arroyo reach semi part beaten india meet win put collins course second seed french open champion she you qi woman doubt trees jolly gayatri gopichand v apriyani rahayu sit facia silva ramadhanti vanish cast ashing ponnappa v young nag ting young put lam swetaparna panda rutaparna panda v in iwanaga die nakanishi trees jolly gayatri gopichand still comeback trail miss large chunk last season best result tour inland reach semi last two edit look lamp qualify yearly hope hayrick deep run tough draw await start indonesia combine apriyani rahayu sit facia silva ramadhanti lead win pit eighth seed may matsumoto wanna nagahara invite world pair when sing when via i fan await quarter woman doubt pair vanish cast ashing ponnappa also look lamp qualify play hong long young nag ting young put lam india beat badminton aria championship last month like play fifth seed hang she in when you win panda sister rutaparna swetaparna also made cut start in iwanaga die nakanishi japan first meet win mean secondround clash second seed back ha a lee he', 'len-raw-text': 1151, 'len-preprocessed-text': 660}, {'_id': ObjectId('669e67c70721cfdbc7ef37aa'), 'url': '', 'category': 'Sports', 'title': '', 'text': 'Today\\'s NBA is harder on LeBron James, Steph Curry than ever before Sunday afternoon after a valuable victory for the Los Angeles Lakers in New Orleans, LeBron James asked aloud how many games he ended up playing in his just-concluded 21st NBA regular season. The answer was officially 71, but really 72 if counting the in-season tournament championship game which awkwardly isn\\'t counted. That\\'s 16 (17, unofficially) more games than last season and the most in his six-year tenure with the Lakers. James shook his head in satisfaction. \"That\\'s pretty cool,\" James said. \"At this point in my career to play 70-plus games and be available for my guys.\" This is reality. To be 39 years old, the oldest active player in the league, and dealing with some chronic injuries to his left ankle and right foot and long-term maintenance of other areas such as his lower back, to play that many games is indeed cool. The Lakers finished the regular season 47-35, four games better than last season, and James thought that was pretty good, too. \"To end the season 12 games over .500, 13 if you count the championship of in-season tournament, for everything we went through,\" James said, \"it\\'s a pretty good season for us.\" This is reality, too. The Lakers finished the season winning 13 of their last 18 games and slipped into eighth in the West at the finish line after spending months stuck in ninth or lower. But for James, reality is easily skewed. He doesn\\'t live in a world where \"good\" seasons are accepted at face value. He shares this status with 36-year-old Steph Curry, who will also compete in Tuesday\\'s play-in tournament. The Golden State Warriors will play the Sacramento Kings just after James takes on the New Orleans Pelicans as the West teams fight to gain entry to the playoffs. James and Curry are superstars of a certain age. Their dominance in their primes and extended run of winning at the highest level has made anything less than that seem like failure. Between 2011 and 2022, either James or Curry played in the Finals for 11 out of 12 years. They played against each other four times. Last season, they played in a series that smashed television ratings records as the Lakers won and James reached his 12th career conference finals. When this is your résumé, you aren\\'t afforded the luxury of simply maximizing your current team\\'s chances. James and Curry are judged aggressively both against ghost adversaries who have long retired and against themselves when they were younger, healthier and played in a less competitive league. \"This last 30 games has just been \\'Operation: Give ourselves a chance,\\'\" Curry said last week. \"You could look at it a lot of different ways. You could look at our record [down the stretch] and extrapolate that out for 82 games and you\\'re probably not in this situation. But all the things we\\'ve gone through and the way the West is stacked, that\\'s our situation. Doesn\\'t really matter.\" The Warriors were 19-24 in late January with Draymond Green suspended, Chris Paul injured and Klay Thompson stuck in a long slump. Stories leaked about role players undermining coach Steve Kerr, and Curry himself was quoting the definition of insanity. The Warriors then went 27-12 to finish the season. But if they lose one of their next two games, they will surely sit through a torrent of \"end of the road\" storylines. In 2016, when they blasted the league en route to 73 wins, the Warriors\\' current 46-36 record would\\'ve had them in the No. 5 seed. The conference\\'s depth now is totally different, and the margin for error is the tightest it has been in the past two decades. \"This whole season has been weird,\" Curry said. The Lakers just completed their second-best regular season in the past 13 years, behind only the 52-win season in 2019-20 that ended in a title. This season, if they have a bad week, James and the Lakers will deal with heavy fallout simply because of the expectations that have been established for the franchise. Like the Warriors, the Lakers will be awarded no bonus points based on a perspective that looks at the entire lay of the land. \"I took a lot of pride in the offseason in getting my foot, my ankle back in order, getting my body back in order,\" James said. \"And it\\'s definitely paid off for me.\" In addition to getting healthier, James adjusted his shooting form and finished the season at 41% from 3-point range, the best of his career. This will end up being a footnote to a footnote. Curry played in 74 games, his most in seven seasons. He had his 10th season of shooting at least 45% overall, 40% from 3 and 90% from the line. But there is next to no interest in this statistic -- Curry normalized great shooting years ago. Instead, he and James will eventually trudge off to the summer, likely listening to plenty of talk about how they\\'ve won their last NBA championships ... when they join up in Paris for Team USA in an attempt to win an Olympic gold medal. This is James and Curry\\'s existence. They are used to heavy expectations and doomsday predictions, and the presumption will be no different this week. \"You can\\'t avoid those conversations; they\\'ve been hovering over us [for years],\" Curry said Monday. \"When you\\'re out on the floor as a player performing at that level and understanding what\\'s expected of yourself and your team, that environment brings the best out of you.\"', 'preprocessed_text': 'today nab harder learn came step curry ever sundae afternoon valuable victory lo angel laker new clean learn came ask aloud man game end play justconclud it nab regular season answer office really count season tournament championship game awkwardly count unofficial game last season midyear tenure laker came shook head satisfact pretty cool came said point career play plus game avail guy reality year old oldest active player league deal chronic injury left ankle right foot longer maintain area lower back play man game index cool laker finish regular season four game better last season came thought pretty good end season game count championship season tournament every went came said pretty good season u reality laker finish season win last game slip eighth west finish line spend month stuck ninth lower came reality easily skew live world good season accept face value share state yearly step curry also compete tuesday playing tournament golden state warrior play sacrament king came take new clean pelican west team fight gain entry playoff came curry superstar certain age domain prime extend run win highest level made any we seem like failure either came curry play final year play four time last season play sari smash televise rate record laker came reach the career confer final resume afford luxury simple maxim current team chance came curry judge aggress ghost adversary long retire younger healthier play we compete league last game over give chance curry said last week could look lot differ way could look record stretch extrabold game probably situate thing gone way west stack situate really matter warrior late jaguar diamond green suspend chi pal injury play tompion stuck long slump story leak role player undermine coach stove err curry quit definite insane warrior went finish season lose one next two game sure sit torrent end road storyline blast league en rout win warrior current record would seed confer depth total differ margin error tightest past two dead whole season weird curry said laker complete secondment regular season past year behind win season end till season bad week came laker deal heavy fallout simple expect establish franchise like warrior laker award bone point base perfect look entire lay land took lot pride offseason get foot ankle back order get body back order came said definite paid admit get healthier came adjust shoot form finish season point rang best career end footnote footnote curry play game seven season the season shoot least overall line next interest statist curry normal great shoot year ago instead came event trudge summer like listen plenty talk last nab championship join part team us attempt win lamp gold medal came curry exist use heavy expect doomsday predict presume differ week cannot avoid covers hover u year curry said money floor player perform level understand expect team environ bring best', 'len-raw-text': 937, 'len-preprocessed-text': 469}, {'_id': ObjectId('669e67d10721cfdbc7ef37ab'), 'url': '', 'category': 'Sports', 'title': '', 'text': \"NBA playoff experts' picks: Predicting Lakers-Pelicans, Kings-Warriors and every play-in game play Mike Greenberg, Tim Legler and Alan Hahn discuss the pros and cons of the Lakers resting their starters vs. the Pelicans in the play-in tournament.

Young, who was born in Salt Lake City, will continue working with the Suns in the playoffs, but will begin assembling a coaching staff that'll immediately start recruiting for BYU, sources said. Young spent eight years coaching in the NBA G League -- including head-coaching jobs with the Utah Flash, Iowa Energy and Delaware 87ers. Young began to gain momentum as a head-coaching candidate in openings a year ago, including interviews with the Milwaukee Bucks, Toronto Raptors, Houston Rockets and Suns. Young previously interviewed for head-coaching jobs with the Philadelphia 76ers, Utah Jazz and Washington Wizards.

Amidst changing dietary attitudes and growing health consciousness with the introduction of HFSS, brands like OaYeah! who make oat-drink based pancakes have capitalised on this shift.\\n\\n\\nA recent survey by BakeAway has shed light on generational disparities in dietary preferences, with Gen Z emerging as champions of the free-from movement. A remarkable 84 percent of Gen Z individuals express an intention to explore or adopt free-from diets in 2024, driven primarily by health considerations.\\n However, taste remains a significant factor, with 41 percent expressing hesitation due to past flavour experiences.\\n\\n\\nMillennials also exhibit a growing interest in free-from diets, particularly for breakfast options. With 63 percent considering the switch for health benefits,\\n this demographic represents a lucrative market segment characterised by a proactive approach to wellness. Their receptiveness to nutritious alternatives underscores the potential for innovation in this space.\\n\\n\\nIn February 2023 BakeAway launched OaYeah! a HFSS compliant readymade pancake brand made from oat-drink and with 45 percent less fat and sugar than regular readymade pancakes. This exemplifies BakeAway’s strategic response to shifting consumer preferences.\\n\\n\\nBy introducing a HFSS compliant oat-based pancake brand tailored to those looking for a convenient healthy breakfast, BakeAway has tapped into a burgeoning demand for alternative breakfast options. OaYeah! addresses both health and taste concerns, offering consumers a delicious health-conscious option without compromising on flavour.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDespite promising growth, challenges persist in addressing taste perceptions and ensuring widespread accessibility. The success of brands like OaYeah! hinges on their ability to navigate these challenges while delivering on consumer expectations for both taste and health benefits.\\n\\n\\nIn addition to health considerations, environmental consciousness plays a pivotal role in shaping consumer choices, particularly among younger demographics. Millennials and Gen Z exhibit a heightened awareness of sustainability issues, influencing their purchasing decisions and brand loyalty. OaYeah!’s commitment to sustainability through the use of oat-based ingredients resonates with eco-conscious consumers, reinforcing its appeal in a competitive market.\\n\\n\\nEncouraging older demographics to embrace free-from or reduced-dairy foods to prioritise sustainability and health presents more of a challenge for the industry. It requires increased focus on delivering a multifaceted approach in comparison to younger consumers. Firstly, providing educational materials and demonstrations can introduce them to these concepts and highlight the benefits of incorporating healthier and sustainable products into their diets.\\n\\n\\nOaYeah! emphasises the delicious flavours, high-quality ingredients, and health benefits of its oat-drink based pancakes. This approach can help the food and beverage industry to overcome taste and quality concerns and maximise profit. That being said, more brands within the market need to take this approach to garner recognition from this challenging demographic.\\n\\n\\nAdditionally, ensuring easy accessibility of these products in mainstream grocery stores and online platforms, along with transparent labelling of sustainability credentials, can make them more appealing to older consumers. By implementing these strategies, businesses can effectively cater to the unique preferences and needs of older demographics, encouraging them to embrace free-from foods and sustainability in their food choices.\\n\\n\\nConvenience has become a key driver in shaping all consumer choices, not just older generations, particularly in the fast-paced lifestyles of today\\n.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0OaYeah!’s chilled, ready-to-eat oat-based pancakes can be ready in minutes, offering a hassle-free solution for busy individuals seeking a nutritious breakfast option. With the ability to be microwaved in minutes, these pancakes cater to consumers’ desire for quick and easy meal solutions without compromising on taste or quality.\\n\\n\\nThis convenience factor has undoubtedly contributed to the success of OaYeah!, as it aligns with the needs and preferences of modern consumers. Food manufacturers looking to replicate this success should prioritise convenience in their product offerings, focusing on creating innovative solutions that streamline meal preparation and cater to consumers’ on-the-go lifestyles.\\n\\n\\nBy providing convenient options that deliver on taste, quality, and nutritional value, manufacturers can meet the evolving demands of today’s consumers and carve out a competitive edge in the free-from and health focussed market.\\n\\n\\nAs consumer awareness of dietary choices expands, the demand for transparency in food labelling and sourcing practices grows. Brands like OaYeah! have an opportunity to further solidify their market presence by emphasising their commitment to ethically sourced ingredients and sustainable production methods.\\n\\n\\nThe ascent of free-from products reflects broader shifts towards mindful consumption and wellness. Through strategic adaptation and a nuanced understanding of consumer preferences, industry professionals can harness this momentum to drive growth and innovation in the food and beverage sector.\\n\\n\\nSales of free-from and HFSS compliant products are expected to rise over the long term, presenting opportunities for innovation and market expansion. While challenges persist, brands like OaYeah! demonstrate the potential for success in meeting evolving consumer needs while contributing to a healthier and more sustainable future.\\n\\n\\nThis underscores the importance of continuous research and development efforts aimed at creating new and improved free-from offerings that cater to diverse dietary requirements and preferences.\\n\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'preprocessed-text': 'year healthconsci pancake sure freeform product stand notable trend reshape consume prefer amidst change dietary attitude grow health conscious introduce of brand like yeah make oatdrink base pancake capitalist shift recent survey takeaway would light gene disbar dietary prefer get z emerge champion freeform movement remark percent get z individual express intent explore adopt freeform diet driven primarily health consider how last remain significs factor percent express heist due past flavor expert millennia also exhibit grow interest freeform diet particularly breakfast option percent conoid switch health benefit demography repress luck market segment characters proactive approach well recept nutrition alter underscore potent into space februari takeaway launch yeah of compliant readymad pancake brand made oatdrink percent we fat sugar regular readymad pancake exemplify takeaway strategy response shift consume prefer introduce of compliant oats pancake brand tailor look convent health breakfast takeaway tap burgeon demand alter breakfast option yeah address health last concern offer consume delict healthconsci option without compromise flavor despite promise growth challenge persist address last percept ensure widespread access success brand like yeah thing bail having challenge deli consume expect last health benefit admit health consider environment conscious play pivot role shape consume choice particularly among younger demography millennia get z exhibit heighten away sustain issue influence purchase decks brand loyalty yeah commit sustain use oats inbred reason ecoconsci consume reinforce appeal compete market encourage older demography embrace freeform reduceddairi food priorities sustain health present challenge industry require increase focus deli multifaceted approach comparison younger consume firstly provide educe mater demons introduce concept highlight benefit incorpor healthier sustain product diet yeah emphasis delict flavor highqual inbred health benefit oatdrink base pancake approach help food beverage industry overcome last quality concern maxims profit said brand within market need take approach garner recognize challenge demography admit ensure easy access product mainstream grocery store online platform along transfer label sustain credent make appeal older consume implement strategy busy effect cater unique prefer need older demography encourage embrace freeform food sustain food choice convent become key driver shape consume choice older gene particularly fastback lifestyle today yeah chill readytoeat oats pancake ready minute offer hasslefre slut busy individual seek nutrition breakfast option bail microwave minute pancake cater consume desire quick easy meal slut without compromise last quality convent factor undoubtedly contribute success yeah align need prefer modern consume food manufacture look replica success priorities convent product offer focus great into slut streamline meal prepare cater consume onthego lifestyle provide convent option deli last quality nutria value manufacture meet evolve demand today consume care compete edge freeform health focus market consume away dietary choice expand demand transfer food label source practice grow brand like yeah opportune solidify market present emphasis commit ethic source inbred sustain product method ascent freeform product reflect broader shift toward mind consult well strategy adapt nuance understand consume prefer industry profession her momentum drive growth into food beverage sector sale freeform of compliant product expect rise long term present opportune into market expand challenge persist brand like yeah demons potent success meet evolve consume need contribute healthier sustain future underscore import continue research develop effort aim great new improve freeform offer cater diver dietary require prefer refer', 'len-raw-text': 820, 'len-preprocessed-text': 527}, {'_id': ObjectId('669e6907e1d7257711209d4d'), 'url': 'https://www.newfoodmagazine.com/article/209874/is-the-plant-based-bubble-bursting/', 'category': 'Food', 'title': 'Is the plant-based bubble bursting?', 'text': '\\n\\nIs the plant-based bubble bursting?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe proportion of UK consumers purchasing plant based alternative food and drink products has near enough doubled in the last decade and the pandemic acted as a catalyst for even quicker growth with fear of a shortage of meat and dairy products and factory closures increasing vegan product sales. At the same time, consumers were reportedly swapping to plant-based alternatives in an effort to boost natural immunity.\\n\\n\\nIncreasingly environmentally conscious consumers and a growing investor appetite for plant-based research and development led to significant opportunities for plant-based businesses. This was reflected in the number of merges and acquisition (M&A) transactions in the plant-based sector, with deal volumes steadily increasing and all signs pointing to this boom continuing.\\n\\n\\nDecreasing demand\\n\\n\\nFast forward to today and the plant-based environment certainly seems more challenging with regular instances of brands withdrawing or decreasing product ranges. Investment in the plant based sub-sector counted for six percent of all food and drink transactions in 2022, and further reduced to just four percent in the first half of 2023. It raises the question: has the vegan bubble burst? The answer is more complicated than the question suggests and is subject to a variety of factors.\\n\\n\\nThe rapid expansion of the plant based sub-sector in the early 2020s has seemingly resulted in an overcrowded market, with supply outstripping demand. The recent performance could possibly be a sign of the sector “correcting” itself post pandemic. In any event, the plant-based market is a relatively new market and it is therefore fairly inevitable that it will see peaks and troughs as it establishes itself and stabilises.\\n\\n\\nThe cost-of-living crisis has also had a big impact on the plant-based sector, particularly for branded vegan products. Vegan products are often seen as more expensive than meat or dairy alternatives, with our survey stating that 54 percent of UK adults consider this to be the case. It is reported that the cost-of-living crisis has impacted consumer willingness to purchase what are considered “expensive” vegan products, where meat and dairy alternatives are cheaper. Branded vegan products are doubly affected by the cost-of-living crisis, as it is reported that some consumers hunt for supermarket own-brand alternatives of plant-based products to cut costs.\\n\\n\\nLooking at the plant-based food landscape provides various examples of decreasing consumer interest and reducing product lines: this year our survey found that one in four UK adults have noticed that there are fewer options for plant-based products in supermarkets.\\n\\n\\nThe high inflation, rising interest rates couple with geopolitical tension and supply disruptions, economic uncertainty, labour shortages and temperamental weather all contribution to the decrease in the volume of M&A activity in the food & drink sector as a whole, with plant-based transactions not avoiding the same fate.\\n\\n\\nWhat next?\\n\\n\\nIn the context of a slowdown in merger & acquisition activity amongst food & drink manufacturers, companies will need to have a strategy to expand market share and diversify product portfolios as well as investing in innovative technologies such as digital and automated process that offer higher productivity levels and are less impacted by persistent labour shortages.\\n\\n\\nCompanies with a strong financial position and private equity investors may view the current landscape as an opportune time to acquire emerging plant-based brands, especially those with innovative products or strong market niches.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nManufacturers may also assess their pricing strategies, with cost already being noted as a significant factor for consumers. Since 39 percent of UK adults claimed to be discouraged from purchasing plant-based products due to cost, it is suggested that manufacturers explore more cost-effective production methods, incorporate digital or automated processes, or focus on products with higher price elasticity.\\n\\n\\nAlthough merger & acquisition activity may not be as explosive as experienced in 2021 and subsequently anticipated, a greater investor focus on innovative technologies could result in a steady flow of merger & acquisition activity.\\n\\n\\nIncreasing predictions of consumers adopting a flexitarian lifestyle in the coming future also suggest a continuing (although not rapidly expanding) market for plant based alternatives and opportunities for innovation. In fact, Sainsburys predicts that 50 percent of UK consumers will be flexitarian by 2025, and it is predicted that the global vegan market may be worth as much as £50 billion by 2030.\\n\\n\\nSales of vegan products are therefore still expected to rise over the long term however the increases and M&A activity may not be as explosive as many initially anticipated, with a greater focus from investors on innovative technologies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'preprocessed-text': 'plants bubble burst report up consume purchase plant base alter food drink product near enough doubt last dead tandem act catalyst even quicker growth fear shortage meat dairy product factory closer increase vegan product sale time consume reportedly swap plants alter effort boost nature immune increasingly environment conscious consume grow investor appetite plants research develop led significs opportune plants busy reflect number mere acquit transact plants sector deal volume steadily increase sign point boom continue decrease demand fast forward today plants environ certainly seem challenge regular instant brand withdraw decrease product rang invest plant base subsection count six percent food drink transact reduce four percent first half raise question vegan bubble burst answer complice question suggest subject variety factor rapid expand plant base subsection early seemingly result overcrowd market supply outstrip demand recent perform could possible sign sector correct post tandem event plants market real new market therefor fairly invite see peak trough establish stabiles costofliv crisis also big impact plants sector particularly brand vegan product vegan product often seen expense meat dairy alter survey state percent up adult conoid case report costofliv crisis impact consume willing purchase conoid expense vegan product meat dairy alter cheaper brand vegan product double affect costofliv crisis report consume hunt supermarket ownbrand alter plants product cut cost look plants food landscape provide various example decrease consume interest reduce product line year survey found one four up adult notice fewer option plants product supermarket high inflate rise interest rate couple geoponic tension supply disrupt economy uncertainty labor shortage temperament weather contribute decrease volume active food drink sector whole plants transact avoid fate next context slowdown merger acquit active amongst food drink manufacture company need strategy expand market share diversify product portfolio well invest into technology digit auto process offer higher product level we impact persist labor shortage company strong finance posit private equity investor may view current landscape opportune time acquire emerge plants brand expect into product strong market nice manufacture may also ass price strategy cost already note significs factor consume since percent up adult claim discourage purchase plants product due cost suggest manufacture explore costeffect product method incorpor digit auto process focus product higher price last although merger acquit active may expos experience subset antics greater investor focus into technology could result steady flow merger acquit active increase predict consume adopt flexitarian lifestyle come future also suggest continue although rapidly expand market plant base alter opportune into fact sainsburi predict percent up consume flexitarian predict global vegan market may worth much billion sale vegan product therefor still expect rise long term how increase active may expos man inti antics greater focus investor into technology', 'len-raw-text': 746, 'len-preprocessed-text': 441}, {'_id': ObjectId('669e6911e1d7257711209d4e'), 'url': 'https://www.newfoodmagazine.com/article/208223/net-zero-a-half-full-or-half-empty-promise-in-the-beverage-industry/', 'category': 'Food', 'title': 'Net zero: A half full or half empty promise in the beverage industry?', 'text': '\\n\\nNet zero: A half full or half empty promise in the beverage industry?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe beverage industry has a big task ahead in its eco-journey. In 2021, it contributed almost 4 percent of the world’s CO2 emissions, with reductions creeping along at just 0.7 percent per year, a far cry from what’s urgently needed .\\n\\n\\nDrinks brands and their partners are now tasked with a radical overhaul that will require an all-hands-on-deck approach to rapidly slash high energy bills and hit looming 2030 and 2050 emissions targets. For starters, partnering up to tackle scope three supply chain emissions is key. Inside the companies themselves, aligning strategies with clear emission goals is vital. This might mean new technology investments, updating operational processes or using data tools to track emission reductions.\\n\\n\\nThis article delves into the transformative journey ahead, exploring innovative partnerships, cutting-edge technology, and strategic shifts within the industry that could redefine its environmental footprint and set a new standard in sustainability.\\n\\n\\nAre current initiatives more than just talk?\\n\\n\\nBig players in the beverage world are already stepping up their game with green initiatives, like Carlsberg’s fibre-based bottles, which the brand claim could slash emissions by up to 80 percent compared to single-use glass bottles. Similarly, Pepsi’s new sustainability platform, ‘Partners for Tomorrow’, is a step in the right direction, unifying its environmental efforts, including its CIRQU recycling programme. We’re also seeing companies publicly share emissions targets, including Coca Cola’s 2030 science-based target to reduce absolution emissions by 25 percent compared with 2015 .\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThese changes are encouraging, but they have to truly deliver on green promises, not just a marketing ploy. Coca Cola is a brand that spent more than $4.3 billion in advertising in 2022\\xa0 so any targets and ambitions must be taken with a pinch of salt. But here’s the catch: it’s not just about reducing emissions. There’s a balance to strike between being eco-friendly and retaining product quality. For instance, switching from classic materials like glass to paper needs to nail the practicality, brand image, and cost trifecta. It’s a tricky balance between green benefits, what the customer wants and what the planet needs.\\n\\n\\nAddressing external pressures\\n\\n\\nThe beverage industry is also feeling the heat from external sources such as stricter EU regulations and global commitments arising from COP28. The rules of the game are constantly changing, most recently with the EU’s Green Claims Directive\\xa0 introducing a push for more detailed claims about emissions and offsets. In response to growing frustration over greenwashing, companies need to back up their environmental messaging with hard facts, ahead of flashy marketing around contentious carbon offsets.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe’ve seen this growing caution manifest in the last few years; for example, Nestlé’s step back from using carbon offsets for brands like KitKat and Nespresso. The pressure is on for brands to avoid legal action. People are also voting green with their wallets as sustainability is an increasingly big draw for customers who want products with smaller carbon footprints, sustainable packaging, and ethical production lines.\\n\\n\\nThe supply chain challenge\\n\\n\\nWrestling supply chain emissions (92 percent of the emissions pie) offers another golden opportunity to dial down environmental impact. It’s a mammoth task to say the least. Plastic packaging is the EU’s main source of plastic waste, with food and beverages making up two fifths of it. Meanwhile, data from 2022 suggests a European beverage manufacturer would have to fork out an extra 20 percent of costs to only use recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) for its bottles.\\n\\n\\nBusinesses are tweaking their processes to reduce water and energy use as well as waste. However to enact change fast enough, we need to see more of a push for collaboration and joint eco-friendly investments. The Beverage Industry Environmental Roundtable is a great example of how the industry can come together to pool resources. Sharing know-how is key, especially for smaller suppliers who might need a hand in greening up their operations. It’s also an opportunity to strengthen ties with other business and provide long-term stability.\\n\\n\\nThis means having a clear strategy in place to achieve net-zero goals that will offer a framework and benchmark for businesses and their partners to score themselves against. While this may sound daunting, brands which are transparent about their emissions whilst looking to improve their green credentials and processes are more attractive to current and future partners.\\n\\n\\nTechnology and innovation: The new frontier\\n\\n\\nFortunately, the beverage industry is getting a tech makeover to tackle its environmental challenges. Take rapid chilling drinks coolers. These nifty devices reduce electricity use and carbon footprint of bars and retail outlets by substituting 24 hour refrigeration for on-demand chilling, offering energy savings of 50-90 percent compared to traditional refrigeration methods. The industry’s diving into other smart refrigeration methods too, including alternative, planet-friendly refrigerants to further reduce emissions from the ‘cold chain’ – the journey drinks take while staying cool.\\n\\n\\nIt’s not stopping at refrigeration either; the entire production line is getting smarter. Companies are switching to energy-efficient machines and tapping into renewable energy. Smart factories are deploying high-tech sensors to track machine elements like performance and temperature to ensure kit on the factory floor is working at optimal efficiencies. Artificial intelligence (AI) and the internet of things (IoT) are playing growing roles here, helping to autonomously act on performance data. The global electrification drive is another green catalyst, offering more sustainable electric delivery vehicles, smarter routing software and AI-driven supply chain management.\\n\\n\\nPackaging’s also getting a high-tech boost. The shift from traditional materials to greener alternatives like biodegradable and recycled alternatives is accelerating. While sustainability has a reputation for being more expensive, brands can actually cut cost by saving on energy or by using recycled materials. Used drinks cans in Europe are actually 20 percent cheaper than new aluminium. Forward-thinking brands will go one step further and shout about these innovations to customers to encourage them to drink more sustainably, creating a positive feedback mechanism that drives further investment in new technology.\\n\\n\\nA glass half full\\n\\n\\nThe beverage industry stands at a pivotal moment in the face of tightening green legislation, evolving consumer demands and economic headwinds. With technological innovations, a push towards sustainable practices, and increasing external pressures, it’s more than just a race against climate change; it’s now about realising a transformational shift in operations and ethos. The industry is embracing change, but the real test lies in delivering on green promises while balancing quality, cost and speed.\\n\\n\\nSmarter production, eco-friendly packaging, and collaborative supply chain strategies are many of the tools available. But to make the most of these, brands need clear environmental goals that will hold them and their partners accountable for any shortcomings. The future of our world depends on the drinks industry ensuring business success and environmental responsibility are not just aligned, but inseparable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'preprocessed-text': 'net

'Food', 'title': 'How manufactures can reduce food waste during food production', 'text': '\\n\\nHow manufactures can reduce food waste during food production\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) had released a report that revealed \\ncomes from manufacturers and production plants that haven’t optimised processes to handle their waste. This backups the importance of food businesses to monitor where they produce the most waste to then implement a strategy to deal with it accordingly.\\n\\n\\nWith that in mind, Andrew Powles, Managing Director of \\n provider FPE Seals has provided his insight for key areas in which food waste could be reduced during production.\\n\\n\\nForecasting accurately\\n\\n\\nThe first place to start is to monitor and analyse existing data to gain knowledge on your products and the waste that you produce, which is essential for building out your waste management strategy and reducing what’s generated. If you analyse the amount of waste that comes from raw materials when producing their products and compare against hod much is sold will help form up a greater picture of the amount of ingredients, you need to order to meet your demands.\\n\\n\\nThere are technologies that exist, like data collection services that can provide a more accurate forecasts that will help optimise your processes better.\\n\\n\\nImprove your packaging quality\\n\\n\\nTo significantly improve the life of food, is to implement better quality packaging. This should be prioritised to reduce waste not only within the supply chain but domestically too. Top-quality packaging throughout the manufacturing chain will also reduce contamination through handling.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThroughout history, packaging uses plastic due to its durability and how well it protects against deterioration when sealed properly. Estimates from the UK government find that more than \\n is introduced to the consumer market annually.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nDespite recyclable plastic technology is improving, it’s still crucial for producers in the manufacturing chain to find a good balance between using plastics that not only preserve food but don’t also contribute to landfill Labelling use by and best before dates should also be included visibly on your packaging, as well as advice on properly storing the product for the longest shelf life.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nInvest in quality assurance and control\\n\\n\\nNot all products are perfect, however if you invest more time into quality assurance and control within the production process, than this can help reduce your waste output. Under and overcooked food needs to be disposed of, but it creates more waste, and having quality products made from the start reduces this risk.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nInvesting in appropriate resources and training your quality control team, can be a great way to ensure your processes are optimised. This can even include integrating automation of more mundane processes to give the workers more time to ensure the quality of your products.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nTraining and transparency\\n\\n\\nIf you conduct appropriate training and encourage transparency across your team around the importance of food waste, this will ensure everyone is invested in the right area. This can be done internally by any training and knowledge department you might have or by bringing in a third-party educator to provide insight into the larger effects of food waste.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nIf you educate your staff about the harmful effects of landfill emissions and chemical contamination, that can obstruct the growth of food production, you’ll accommodate a more positive company culture that share the same attitude towards food waste.\\n\\n\\nWith this education, not only will your staff feel invested in, they’d also be able to communicate problems within processes that they gain perspective on that can help further optimise your food waste. These habits will help to build positive values and habits in your business.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nFurthermore, providing your team with the latest technologies and training them to operate them can help improve all aspects of food production.\\n\\n\\nSources\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'preprocessed-text': 'manufacture reduce food wast food product wast resource action program wrap release report reveal come manufacture product plant optimism process hands wast backup import food busy monitor produce wast implement strategy deal accordingly mind drew pool manage director provide fee seal provide insight key area food wast could reduce product forecast occur first place start monitor analyst exist data gain knowledge product wast produce essential build wast manage strategy reduce gene analyst amount wast come raw mater produce product compare hod much sold help form greater picture amount inbred need order meet demand technology exist like data collect service provide occur forecast help optimism process better improve package quality significantly improve life food implement better quality package priorities reduce wast within supply chain domes topical package throughout manufacture chain also reduce contain hands throughout history package use plastic due durable well protect interior seal properly swim up govern find introduce consume market annual despite recycle plastic technology improve still crucial produce manufacture chain find good balance use plastic preserve food also contribute landfill label use best date also include visible package well advice properly store product longest shelf life invest quality assure control product perfect how invest time quality assure control within product process help reduce wast output overcook food need dispose great wast quality product made start reduce risk invest appropri resource train quality control team great way ensure process optimism even include inter auto mundane process give worker time ensure quality product train transfer conduct appropri train encourage transfer across team around import food wast ensure everyone invest right area done intern train knowledge depart might bring thirdparti educe provide insight larger effect food wast educe staff harm effect landfill miss hemic contain obstruct growth food product accommod posit company culture share attitude toward food wast educe staff feel invest would also all common problem within process gain perfect help optimism food wast habit help build posit value habit busy furthermore provide team latest technology train over help improve aspect food product source', 'len-raw-text': 609, 'len-preprocessed-text': 335}, {'_id': ObjectId('669e691fe1d7257711209d50'), 'url': 'https://www.newfoodmagazine.com/article/197473/eating-smart-innovating-food-for-health-flavour-and-the-planet/', 'category': 'Food', 'title': 'Eating smart: Innovating food for health, flavour and the planet', 'text': '\\n\\nEating smart: Innovating food for health, flavour and the planet\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn November 2023, the world’s population hit eight billion. The United Nations (UN) has projected the figure to climb even higher – to 9.7 billion by 2050.\\n\\n\\nIf we continue to produce, supply and consume food in the same ways, we will need the resources of not only one but \\n Planet Earths to feed nearly 10 billion people adequately.\\n\\n\\nNeedless to say, there is no Planet B, or for that matter Planet C. To solve the challenge of sustaining everyone on our one and only planet, the food industry must play a critical role – we need to innovate sustainable nutrition solutions that provide healthy diets to people while minimising the environmental impact.\\n\\n\\nIn this article, I will discuss the challenges of the global food system and explore how the food industry can drive change through sustainable nutrition innovations.\\n\\n\\nChallenges of the global food system\\n\\n\\nThe global food system is grappling with complex and interlinked challenges that affect the health of people and the planet.\\n\\n\\nWith the prevalence of unhealthy diets and sedentary lifestyles, obesity has almost tripled worldwide since 1975. Now, two billion men, women and children are overweight or obese and at higher risk of non-communicable diseases like Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.\\n\\n\\nYet, at the same time, over 700 million people are hungry or undernourished, with limited access to affordable and nutritious food due to poverty, climate change or war and conflict.\\n\\n\\nDespite many lacking the food and nutrients they need to support health, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that one-third of all food produced – over 1.3 billion tons – is lost or wasted annually. This food is thrown away either on the way from farms to markets, or in homes, retail or food service, before people have a chance to eat it.\\n\\n\\nFood loss and waste hurt the planet’s health too. All the resources put into production, such as water, energy, land and labour, are wasted when the food does not eventually reach consumers. Moreover, food waste discarded into landfills decomposes and emits methane, a greenhouse gas, contributing to global warming.\\n\\n\\nIn fact, according to naturefood.com, the global food system is responsible for more than 30 percent of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. The contributions come from the entire supply chain, from agricultural activities, transport and processing to packaging, retail and disposal.\\n\\n\\nRise of the AND consumer\\n\\n\\nIncreasingly, consumers recognise what they eat impacts their health and the environment. They have leaned into sustainability with their actions:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis rising class of consumers, known as AND consumers, places increasing importance on personal health and planetary well-being. The products they buy must meet multiple criteria – tasty \\n healthier \\n convenient \\n affordable \\n sustainable.\\n\\n\\nCreating healthier food environments\\n\\n\\nWhile consumers are taking a stand on sustainability, governments face mounting pressure to monitor and regulate their food supply to create healthier food environments for their people.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExcessive sodium intake is a significant risk factor for stroke, heart disease, some cancers and premature death. According to the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019, an estimated 1.89 million diet-related deaths each year are linked to excessive sodium intake.\\n\\n\\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends less than 5 grams of salt per day, but the global average salt intake is estimated to be at least double that at 10.8 grams per day.\\n\\n\\nEven though the WHO has set a global target of reducing sodium intake by 30 percent by 2025, its Global Report on Sodium Intake Reduction noted that the world is still off track as of 2023 to achieve this target.\\n\\n\\nCurrently, only 27 percent of the world’s population live in countries with mandatory measures for sodium reduction. The main reason is that most governments have yet to adopt compulsory policies and have left businesses to reduce sodium in food products voluntarily.\\n\\n\\nAccording to WHO, in the Middle East, North Africa and Turkiye (MENAT) region, only a handful of countries – Bahrain, Iran, Qatar, Turkiye, United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia – have introduced mandatory measures to reduce sodium or help consumers make healthier food choices with compulsory labelling of sodium content on all pre-packaged food.\\n\\n\\nSaudi Arabia has gone one step further by implementing the WHO’s recommended interventions related to sodium that help prevent non-communicable diseases. These interventions include:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDiets high in refined carbohydrates and sugar contribute to overweight and obesity. In the WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean Region, for example, 53 percent of adult women and 45 percent of adult men are overweight or obese. The region also has the highest rate of diabetes at nearly 14 percent of the population.\\n\\n\\nThe WHO has set a target for the MENAT region to reduce obesity in children and adults by 35 percent. It has recommended that governments implement nutrition labelling that supports healthy choices and monitor the food environment for nutritional quality, prices, and marketing practices.\\n\\n\\nOnly a few countries within the region have introduced traffic light labelling on food products. The label indicates the sugar, salt and fat levels to help consumers make healthier food choices. Iran has made such labelling mandatory, while Saudi Arabia has made it voluntary.\\n\\n\\nSeveral countries in the region, including Saudi Arabia and UAE, have also rolled out a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages. Saudi Arabia, in particular, has seen encouraging results following a sugar tax of 50 percent – a 35 percent reduction in the sales of carbonated beverages.\\n\\n\\nHow the food industry can drive change\\n\\n\\nThe planet’s wellbeing is in jeopardy. Countries face public health crises despite some measures to stem obesity and prevent non-communicable diseases. And consumers increasingly seek sustainable products that benefit them and the environment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt Kerry, we work with our customers to help them move along the sustainable nutrition spectrum where they can produce healthier, tasty foods while cutting carbon emissions and food waste. The range and complexity of challenges our industry is facing right now is unprecedented and there is an urgency for the food industry to step up and proactively develop sustainable nutrition solutions. How then can the food industry make a meaningful difference by creating sustainable nutrition solutions?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConsumers are becoming more conscious of eating healthier diets. Governments are introducing taxes and regulations on products high in fat, sugar and salt to tackle obesity and prevent non-communicable diseases.\\n\\n\\nThe food industry is hence feeling the heat to reformulate existing products. The good news is that manufacturers can now leverage available taste modulation technology such as Kerry’s \\n to successfully reduce sugar and salt to meet nutritional guidelines while retaining their products’ appealing taste.\\n\\n\\nFood manufacturers can also use digital tools in the market such as the\\xa0 \\n to predict how changes in ingredients or recipes will affect their products’ nutritional profiles.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne way to address the issue of food waste is by developing products with a longer shelf life. Take, for example, bakeries. Bakeries create a lot of waste due to the short shelf life of bakery goods.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nBy creating more resilient and longer-lasting products, such as with enzymes and fermented ingredients, food manufacturers can eliminate visual discards and help reduce emissions associated with landfill waste. Kerry’s \\n helps companies and individuals quantify the impacts of food waste.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWith health and sustainability at the top of their minds, more consumers are opting for nutrient-dense plant-based alternatives that also come with lower greenhouse gas emissions.\\n\\n\\nStill, taste is the number one reason consumers favour one product over another. To appeal to a broad range of consumers with varying dietary needs and demands, food manufacturers must develop \\n that offer the same desirable taste, texture, functionality and nutrition as animal-based counterparts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOver the past decade there has been a proliferation of front of pack nutrition labelling globally (e.g., NutriScore, Traffic Light Label and Health star rating) which aim to guide and inform consumers to make healthier food choices at the point of purchase. More recently, eco-labels are also entering the market with front of pack ratings to help consumers to understand the environmental impact of their purchases.\\n\\n\\nEven though there are challenges in standardisation and consumers may still need more education to fully understand what the labels mean, these labels are still a useful tool for educating consumers on the health and environmental impact of their purchases.\\n\\n\\nNutritional and eco labelling may also motivate producers to create better-for-health food, reduce their carbon footprints and develop sustainable products.\\n\\n\\nCollaboration is key\\n\\n\\nThe world faces complex and urgent challenges in global health and environmental sustainability. We can no longer wait on or rely on a single party to take action.\\n\\n\\nAs the food industry seeks to respond to these challenges in addition to regulatory and consumer demands, it makes sense to collaborate with partners that can support them in creating products that deliver even more value in sustainable nutrition.\\n\\n\\nThe food industry must thus unite to innovate in sustainable nutrition. This shift is essential not just for consumer and planetary health but also for economic benefits. Collaborative efforts are vital to making a more meaningful impact, creating foods that are better for people, society and the planet.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'preprocessed-text': \"eat smart into food

'text': '\\n\\nHarnessing data and AI to improve food quality and safety\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFood safety isn’t just a nice to have; it’s essential to operating legally and safely. Understanding the full supply chain and the food safety risks associated with it will determine the strategy to control and mitigate risks. And it’s something that needs to be monitored closely and carefully, especially as deviations can occur at any point in the supply chain at any time. That makes food safety monitoring systems crucial in managing risk and keeping quality consistent.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nBut that also takes time. Across the food industry, thousands of hours are spent every year ensuring that the food ingredients created for consumers to enjoy is being produced to the highest standards. Finding more efficient, reliable ways to monitor food safety is top of any manufacturer’s list, especially when speed and efficiency are crucial in keeping production lines running and customers supplied. As global supply chains face numerous pressures, any way to improve productivity and reliability can help the food industry deliver for consumers. That’s where innovation comes in.\\n\\n\\nEmerging technologies are creating exciting possibilities for food safety. The quicker food quality or safety issues are flagged up, the quicker they can be resolved. New technology can not only help improve the speed and accuracy of food quality monitoring but also enhance the traceability of food supply chains, which are often complex and challenging to navigate. It’s still early days for the industry, but at ofi, we have been testing different approaches.\\n\\n\\nTake our laboratory testing facility in Koog aan der Zaan in the Netherlands. Previously, we captured measurements from the equipment used to process cocoa ingredients manually, which was relatively time-consuming. By introducing a laboratory information management system (LIMS) where the equipment captures data directly and feeds it into our systems, it removes the need for manual data capture. This means we can collect the measurements we need much more regularly and quickly. We’ve also improved the speed of our analysis by using more infrared equipment technology (NIRs) across many of our cocoa processing sites. Where one measurement previously took 30-45 minutes, it now takes only five minutes. That means we can take more measurements and capture more reliable data as a result.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the real potential of these technologies lies in what can be achieved if they are scaled. With data captured all in one system, we can perform quicker traceability between the farm and the factory.\\n\\n\\nLikewise, we are looking to install additional NIRs at our cocoa facilities to complement our existing systems. The more sensors we can install will help us build a better picture of our operations – and in doing so, help improve product quality for our customers.\\n\\n\\nIncreasing the amount of data, we are able to capture across our supply chain also opens up exciting possibilities for AI. As we capture more data, we will also need to be able to process more information in real-time. AI systems will one day be able to do just that, helping us build an even more accurate and powerful food safety system.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nTake one example of a common issue that can affect cocoa bean quality: wet weather conditions. If the weather in a cocoa-sourcing country is particularly wet, it can affect the levels of Free Fatty Acids (FFAs) in the final product. In fact, if the FFA levels are too high, the final product will have an unpleasant taste and be unsuitable for use. That’s where AI comes in. In the future, AI tools could help process real-time food quality measurements from our processing facilities across the globe, alongside data on weather conditions at the beans’ origin. This analysis could help us estimate the quality of the finished product and adjust our processing accordingly, ultimately helping us to better plan, predict inconsistencies, reduce waste, and enhance the traceability of our supply chain.\\n\\n\\nTechnology is clearly changing the game in food quality and safety and is creating some exciting possibilities to improve safety and efficiency across the supply chain. As technology improvements allow us to better harness data across our supply chain, we will be able to better monitor and improve food quality from plant to palate. That will not only help improve the speed and accuracy of our operations but also help deliver a higher quality and more consistent product for consumers to enjoy.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'preprocessed-text': 'her data ai improve food quality safety food safety nice essential over legal safe understand full supply chain food safety risk cassock determine strategy control mitis risk some need monitor close care expect deviate occur point supply chain time make food safety monitor system crucial manage risk keep quality consist also take time across food industry thousand hour spent ever year ensure food inbred great consume enjoy produce highest standard find office reliable way monitor food safety top manufacture list expect speed office crucial keep product line run custom supply global supply chain face number pressure way improve product reliable help food industry deli consume into come emerge technology great exit possible food safety quicker food quality safety issue flag quicker resolve new technology help improve speed accuracy food quality monitor also enhance traceable food supply chain often complex challenge having still early day industry of test differ approach take laboratory test fail kook can her naan netherlands previous capture measure equip use process cocoa inbred manual real timeconsum introduce laboratory inform manage system him equip capture data directly feed system remove need manual data capture mean collect measure need much regularly quickly also improve speed analysis use infra equip technology air across man cocoa process site one measure previous took minute take five minute mean take measure capture reliable data result real potent technology lie achieve scale data capture one system perform quicker traceable farm factory likewise look instal admit air cocoa fail complement exist system sensor instal help u build better picture over help improve product quality custom increase amount data all capture across supply chain also open exit possible ai capture data also need all process inform reality ai system one day all help u build even occur power food safety system take one example common issue affect cocoa bean quality wet weather conduit weather cocoasourc country particularly wet affect level free fatty acid fa final product fact fa level high final product unless last sunsuit use ai come future ai tool could help process reality food quality measure process fail across globe alongside data weather conduit bean origin analysis could help u swim quality finish product adjust process accordingly ultima help u better plan predict consist reduce wast enhance traceable supply chain technology clearly change game food quality safety great exit possible improve safety office across supply chain technology improve allow u better her data across supply chain all better monitor improve food quality plant palate help improve speed accuracy over also help deli higher quality consist product consume enjoy', 'len-raw-text': 726, 'len-preprocessed-text': 424}, {'_id': ObjectId('669e6930e1d7257711209d52'), 'url': 'https://www.newfoodmagazine.com/article/197306/whats-on-the-menu-five-food-trend-predictions-for-2024/', 'category': 'Food', 'title': 'What’s on the menu?

Five food trend predictions for 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s the start of a new year which, for \\n, means looking ahead to the next twelve months and predicting what trends will dominate the food and beverage industry in 2024.\\n\\n\\nThis year, \\n Grace Galler has called on various members of the \\nAdvisory Board who have been keeping their ear firmly to the ground in order to understand exactly how the food and beverage landscape will shape up in 12 months ahead.\\n\\n\\nThere is no crystal ball to determine what the trends the food sector will be well accustomed to come December 2024, but there is research and experts in the field to help up better understand the evolving preferences, innovations, and societal shifts that will likely define the industry.\\n\\n\\nSo what will be taken off the menu this year? And how might preferences be changing? Let’s investigate.\\n\\n\\nA gut feeling about probiotics\\n\\n\\nAt the start of every year, many consumers turn their attention to health and nutrition. With \\n predicting that “healthy ageing will be redefined by debunking ‘old’ stigmas and prioritising extending consumers’ healthy years”, what’s poised to experience a surge in interest throughout 2024?\\n\\n\\nGut health had been a \\n on Google during 2023, with interest significantly rising in the last quarter of the year. Thanks to an increasingly informed consumer base prioritising wellness, there has already been a surge in products tailored to support digestive health.\\n\\n\\nProbiotics, prebiotics, and functional foods may well take centre stage in the months ahead, products that offer a diverse array of options aiming to balance and nourish the gut microbiome. From fermented foods like kimchi and kombucha to innovative probiotic-infused snacks and beverages, the evolving market reflects an interest in promoting gut well-being.\\n\\n\\nWith \\n from the likes of the Global Prebiotic Association highlighting that “probiotics, prebiotics and polyphenols have been shown to benefit the microbiota and to reduce risk of CVD”, education surrounding this trend is plentiful and allows consumers to consider the potential link between gut health and overall wellness.\\n\\n\\nSterling Crew, President of the Institute of Food Science and Technology (IFST) and \\n Advisory Board Member agrees that gut health is likely to take centre stage in 2024: “I have a gut feeling that we will see the emergence of the microbiome being a driver in new food development.\\n\\n\\n“In recent years it has become a key increasingly clear that a gut full of friendly microbes is vital for our good health. We are gathering greater knowledge about how our gut microbiome and food affects our mood and general health. Scientists are still learning about exactly how food influences us but it does seems like the gut microbiome plays a major part.”\\n\\n\\n“With products which have over five billion live cultures from 14 strains of bacteria. I believe this type of development will become new mega trend in the future.”\\n\\n\\nTastes from around the world\\n\\n\\nIngredients aren’t just components anymore. They are a gateway to exploring tastes from all four corners of the earth and, in 2024, its likely that consumers will continue to explore and embrace an eclectic array of international tastes and culinary traditions.\\n\\n\\nSeeking authenticity and adventure in their dining experiences, consumers are fostering a culinary revolution that not only celebrates global diversity but also encourages food and beverage creators to explore new frontiers in flavour profiles.\\n\\n\\nUren Food Ingredients has forecasted that \\n will be a major influence throughout the upcoming year, with a specific focus on flavours and ingredients from Africa, South America and the Middle East.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“We expect consumer demand for adventurous global fusion cuisine to continue. Consumers are always on the lookout for unique and exotic flavours from different cultures, making it a great opportunity for chefs and food manufacturers to get creative with their menus,” Uren revealed in a report.\\n\\n\\nOn this topic, Mecca Ibrahim, Co-Founder of Women in the Food Industry and \\n Advisory Board member shone a spotlight on Korean and South East Asian late-night foods, predicting that they will be “bigger than ever” this year.\\n\\n\\n“We have already seen the massive rise in food and experiences inspired by K-Pop and K-Dramas such as Squid Game. The West End is already showing signs of late-night food not being based around falling out of a night-club and then eating a kebab or KFC, but healthier trends of elaborate frozen desserts, teas and varieties of sweetcorn are taking hold.\\n\\n\\n“Flavours from Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, Southeast Asian, Japan and the Philippines show no sign of abating and I think that Korean Gochujang will become as ubiquitous as Sriracha was in its day and may even be seen in takeaways alongside brown sauce, mayo and vinegar.”\\n\\n\\nThis year beckons food enterprises to not just tap into but embrace the flavours and authenticity of various cultures, perhaps redefining menus and product lines.\\n\\n\\nAI fuelled food safety\\n\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) has been a hot topic for a while now. Widely discussed at \\nFood Integrity Global conference, experts gathered to determine just how this powerful tool can be used to strengthen food safety. In fact, Crew told New Food that he believes it could “play a major role in helping to reduce world hunger”.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut how is it useful? The application of AI can be extended across the entire food supply chain, leveraging predictive analytics, machine learning, and real-time monitoring to enhance safety protocols. It can also be adopted by large and small scale manufacturing businesses to identify risks, facilitate swift intervention and prevent contamination or outbreaks.\\n\\n\\nWhen asked how he think AI could transform the sector in 2024, Crew shared: “I think that we are all still coming to terms with the potential impact of AI. I personally believe that we are going through the fourth industrial revolution. I believe it will enable us to deliver an even higher level of food safety.\\n\\n\\n“By using AI and optical imaging we could quickly and accurately identify pathogens in food, helping to prevent foodborne outbreaks and illnesses. AI will enable us to become more aware of food safety risks in our manufacturing environments and be able to pinpoint corrective actions. It will help us improve crop yields, quality, nutrition and traceability while decreasing resource consumption and hopefully help to eliminate food waste.”\\n\\n\\nHowever this emerging technology doesn’t come without its concerns, with Crew noting that it will “undoubtedly” replace a number of food sector technical jobs.\\n\\n\\nLess ultra-processed\\n\\n\\nBack in October 2022, the UK Government introduced a \\n on the promotion of high in fat, salt or sugar (HFSS) products, something that caused quite a \\n in the sector.\\n\\n\\nThough the restriction of HFSS products by location came into force on 1 October 2022, restriction by volume price will be activated on 1 October 2025. But where does that leave us in 2024?\\n\\n\\nAs part of its trends report, Mintel claimed that “clear communication will become necessary to help consumers make informed decisions about how processed and ultra-processed food and drink fit into their diets”. With this in mind, manufacturers and retailers appear to be actively reevaluating their product portfolios and marketing strategies, with an increased focus on reformulating existing products to reduce HFSS content.\\n\\n\\nIn fact, CEO of Produced in Kent, Floortje Hoette, has noticed that there has been some “really innovative independent businesses using ingredients, where quality takes precedence and processing is considered to ensure maximum taste and minimum additives.”\\n\\n\\nCould the increasing awareness of the health implications associated with ultra-processed foods be driving a shift toward favouring whole, natural ingredients? Only the next 12 months will tell.\\n\\n\\nLocalised food solutions\\n\\n\\nThough the Food and Drink Federation (FDF) reported that food exports during the first half of 2023 rose to almost \\n, at the end of last year, the World Bank observed that, as of December 11, 2023, 19 countries had implemented 27 \\n.\\n\\n\\nWith cases of extreme weather impacting farming across the globe, including the \\n, the interconnectedness of global food trade has witnessed a shift and forced the sector to re-evaluate trade between countries.\\n\\n\\nSpeaking on our “Food to Go” podcast, Professor Chris Elliott warned the industry that, due to the “ongoing impact of a climate crisis, we have to expect more and more food shortages.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“The fresh produce supply chains are already very stretched. We’ve had massive climate problems happening in different parts of the world where we source a lot of our food stuffs from. I think more empty supermarket shelfs for longer is my prediction for this year,” continued Elliott.\\n\\n\\nSo how should the food and beverage sector respond to this concerning prediction? Well, according to Elliott, 2024 is a key year to consider deglobalisation “looking after your own population, and making sure they are fed properly”.\\n\\n\\nWith the Environment Secretary, Steve Barclay, recently announcing plans to back British farmers by utilising \\n for British food produce, including the use of a UK GI logo on food packaging, the urgency for consumers to support farmer’s close to home is evident.\\n\\n\\nThe food sector is no stranger to adaptation. We witnessed first-hand just how agile it can be during difficult periods such as the COVID-19 pandemic. With climate change being a concern worldwide, the urgency for consumers to support farmers close to home becomes increasingly apparent, signalling a potential shift towards more in-country food consumption in 2024.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'preprocessed-text': 'menu five food trend predict start new year mean look ahead next twelve month predict trend domain food beverage industry

'\\n\\nTurning up the dial on frozen\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), the food system contributes a third of global greenhouse gas emissions. We know that failure to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change not only threatens lives and livelihoods across the world but could materially impact many businesses. Therefore, every food business must play its part in reducing greenhouse gas emissions across the value chain.\\n\\n\\nFrozen food may not be front of mind for most people when they think about how to reduce their carbon footprint and so as Europe’s leader in frozen food we are on a mission to make sure the benefits of frozen are better understood – at the same time as we continue to put nutritious, tasty, affordable and responsibly produced food on consumer tables and find ways to manage our business and our supply chain more efficiently. \\xa0\\n\\n\\nFrozen in time\\xa0\\n\\n\\nIn 2024, we will celebrate the centenary of one the most crucial inventions that’s shaped food manufacturing for generations: the flash-freezing process. Clarence Birdseye revolutionised the method of freezing fresh fish in 1924 and to this day, the same method of preserving the freshness of fish, meat and vegetables without compromising on its quality, nutritional value and taste has been used by the global food manufacturing industry.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere is another area in frozen food, which has also remained unaltered for generations: the assumed temperature at which we store our frozen food products – from wholesaler to retailer – and at home too!\\u202fWhy has this not changed we wondered – and could making even a small change to the temperature that we store frozen food be a way to make a huge reduction in energy use! \\xa0\\n\\n\\nBuilding on Clarence’s legacy of innovation\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\nGiven our position as Europe’s leading frozen food company and the proud owner of the Birds Eye brand in key markets including the UK, Nomad Foods\\xa0decided to launch a breakthrough project aimed at exploring whether temperatures above –18C / 0F (the industry standard) can be targeted to store frozen food, without any negative implications on the quality or safety of products.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWorking with leading global external research partner, Campden BRI, we commissioned a\\xa0pilot study, focusing on nine savoury products from across the Nomad Foods portfolio including poultry, natural fish, coated fish, vegetables, plant-based products from the ‘Green Cuisine’ range and pizza. The eight areas for analysis were microbiological, texture, oxidative rancidity, drip loss, nutrition, energy use and packaging. The temperatures used for testing were -18, -15, -12 and -9 centigrade.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nIn terms of scale, we believe this to be a ‘first of its kind’ study, given the data for this kind of research doesn’t currently exist anywhere else.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nOur study also follows the industry leading research we previously announced in 2022, focused on the \\n of frozen food, which showed that category performs very well against alternative preservation methods in terms of carbon footprint, partly due to much lower levels of food waste.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWhat the results tell us \\u202f\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe initial six-month pilot study in 2023 showed encouraging results against all the test criteria. All products remained micro-safe, there were no signs of oxidative rancidity, minor change in texture (Mixed Veg on -9oC, and Salmon Filets at -12oC.) and most crucially for today’s debate, it showed that for every 3oC increase in temperature there was a drop of 10-11 percent in energy consumption.\\u202f\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSpeaking about the results of the first six month pilot, our CEO, Stefan Descheemaeker, says: “This new pilot study with Campden BRI shows that we have the potential to significantly reduce energy use when storing frozen products, without reformulating. Delivered at scale, this could revolutionise our industry and deliver substantial energy use and cost reductions for manufacturers, food retailers and consumers and further reduce the carbon footprint of frozen food products.”\\xa0\\n\\n\\nEmma Hanby, Associate Director at Campden BRI has said: “We have shown that an increase in freezer temperatures to -15 degrees C (from the industry standard of -18 degrees C) reduces energy consumption without any decrease in product safety or quality.”\\xa0\\n\\n\\nSo, what’s next?\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWe anticipate announcing the twelve month results early in 2024 and should they be as promising for longer term freezing as the initial six month study, then there will be a huge incentive – if not necessity – for the industry as a whole to be galvanised into action.\\u202f\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWe’re already encouraged to see many business partners and external stakeholders recognising the importance of this issue publicly. For example, the British Frozen Food Federation (BFFF), the UK’s frozen food trade association, with over 200 members comprising producers, wholesalers, importers, exporters, brokers, retailers and related associate businesses. Its CEO, Rupert Ashby, says: “The industry has a duty to look at how it can be sustainable and efficient. Increasing freezer temperatures is one area that could be a potential answer”, before adding “there will need to be collaboration not just in the UK but worldwide and there will need to be changes in legislation and how it impacts different foods.”\\xa0\\n\\n\\nIndustry-wide collaboration is essential to this venture truly succeeding. Whilst Nomad Foods, with our diverse portfolio of products, broad supply chain, and operations across multiple European markets, is in a key position to drive change, we recognise we cannot do this alone. \\xa0\\n\\n\\nClarence Birdseye led the way 100 years ago. Our hope is that we can come together as an industry to build on his legacy and transform the next 100 years and beyond for the benefit of our consumers, our communities and our planet? We know this will be challenging but we are excited about the potential for change and the opportunity we have to work with and learn from other businesses and key stakeholders. \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'preprocessed-text': 'turn dial frozen accord unit nation food agriculture organic far food system contribute third global greenhouse a miss know failure mitis worst impact climate change threaten live livelihood across world could mater impact man busy therefor ever food busy must play part reduce greenhouse a miss across value chain frozen food may front mind people think reduce carbon footprint euros leader frozen food mission make sure benefit frozen better understood time continue put nutrition taste afford response produce food consume table find way manage busy supply chain office frozen time celebs centenary one crucial invent shape food manufacture gene flashfreez process clarence birds revolutions method free fresh fish day method preserve fresh fish meat beget without compromise quality nutria value last use global food manufacture industry azoth area frozen food also remain unapt gene assume temperature store frozen food product wholesale retail home change wonder could make even small change temperature store frozen food way make huge reduce energy use build clarence legacy into given posit euros lead frozen food company proud owner bird eye brand key market include up nomad food decide launch breakthrough project aim explore whether temperature c f industry standard target store frozen food without new imply quality safety product work lead global extern research partner camped bra commits pilot study focus nine savor product across nomad food portfolio include poultry nature fish coat fish beget plants product green cuisine rang pizza eight area analysis microbiology texture oxide rancid drip loss nutria energy use package temperature use test centigrade term scale believe first kind study given data kind research current exist anywhere el study also follow industry lead research previous announce focus frozen food show category perform well alter preserve method term carbon footprint partly due much lower level food wast result tell u inti sixmonth pilot study show encourage result test criterion product remain micros sign oxide rancid minor change texture mix veg of salmon filet of crucial today debt show ever of increase temperature drop percent energy consult speak result first six month pilot coo steal descheemaek say new pilot study camped bra show potent significantly reduce energy use store frozen product without reform deli scale could revolutions industry deli substance energy use cost reduce manufacture food retail consume reduce carbon footprint frozen food product gemma hands cassock director camped bra said shown increase freezer temperature degree c industry standard degree c reduce energy consult without decrease product safety quality next antics announce twelve month result early promise longer term free inti six month study huge invent recess industry whole galvanic action already encourage see man busy partner extern stokehold recognize import issue publicly example brutish frozen food fever buff up frozen food trade cassock member comprise produce wholesale import export broker retail relax cassock busy coo report ashes say industry duty look sustain office increase freezer temperature one area could potent answer ad need collator up worldwide need change legist impact differ food industrywid collator essential venture truly succeed whilst nomad food diver portfolio product broad supply chain over across multiple european market key posit drive change recognize cannot along clarence birds led way year ago hope come together industry build legacy transform next year beyond benefit consume common planet know challenge exit potent change opportune work learn busy key stokehold', 'len-raw-text': 955, 'len-preprocessed-text': 548}, {'_id': ObjectId('669e693de1d7257711209d54'), 'url': 'https://www.newfoodmagazine.com/article/196888/the-meat-of-the-matter-how-livestock-fared-at-cop28/', 'category': 'Food', 'title': 'The meat of the matter: how livestock fared at COP28', 'text': '\\n\\nThe meat of the matter: how livestock fared at COP28\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis year’s UN COP28 climate talks in Dubai were the first to make food and agriculture an explicit priority of the presidency. Not only did food, agriculture and water have a dedicated thematic day and several pavilions, but the summit opened with more than 130 countries signing up to the \\n on Sustainable Agriculture, Resilient Food Systems and Climate Action.\\n\\n\\nThe linkages between global food systems and climate change are becoming increasingly clear and urgent. Mounting evidence shows that the way countries produce, consume and dispose of food generates around a \\n of the greenhouse gas emissions that are driving up global temperatures. But more and more countries, especially those in the Global South, are also facing the reality that higher temperatures, erratic rainfall and climate extremes are in turn making farming increasingly difficult, threatening food security and livelihoods.\\n\\n\\nGovernments therefore face the challenge of needing to rapidly reduce agricultural emissions while at the same time, ensuring that farmers can produce enough healthy, safe and affordable food to meet growing demand.\\n\\n\\nAnimal agriculture plays a particularly significant role in the race to climate-resilient food systems. Globally, the livestock sector is estimated to be responsible for \\n of direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions, 44 per cent of which are methane. But in regions such as Africa, livestock and animal-source foods have a lower environmental footprint and offer vital climate resilience to heat, drought and climate shocks, while also reducing nutrient deficiencies and rural poverty.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter a slew of side events, panel discussions and sessions, it is clear that the climate debate must carefully nuance its position on animal agriculture to ensure that the vital benefits it offers, especially to developing countries, are not compromised in the race to Net Zero.\\n\\n\\nFood choice is a privilege\\n\\n\\nWhen it comes to production, consumption, nutrition and health, one thing is clear: the Global North and Global South food systems need climate funding for different solutions. This was the takeaway from The Great Food Debate: Let Them Talk, convened by the International Livestock Research Institute and ProVeg.\\n\\n\\nActions towards developing more sustainable food systems must not leave behind the most vulnerable consumers. Climate action must therefore consider social justice. This includes children in the Global North who are being presented with unhealthy, processed foods as well as those in the Global South who are unable to access a balanced diet.\\n\\n\\nReducing the overconsumption of meat in developed countries would both improve diets and reduce agricultural emissions. But in Africa, pastoralists play a vital role, producing \\n the continent’s meat and milk, a daily glass of which helps children develop both physically and cognitively.\\n\\n\\nClimate finance and policies must therefore take into account how best to support these different outcomes, from shifting diets in high-income countries to enabling pastoralists to adapt to climate change with innovations like index-based insurance and improved livestock feed.\\n\\n\\nClimate winners and losers\\n\\n\\nWithin the question of climate justice is the question of dietary justice, and this raises the issue of power and voice.\\n\\n\\nIn a session on achieving climate and nutrition goals through animal agriculture, Vivian Maduekeh from the Global Alliance of the Future of Food outlined six guiding principles to consider when debating the merits of plant-based diets versus animal-source foods. These included:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPutting farmers first\\n\\n\\nDiscussions about transforming food systems for a climate crisis often omit those on the frontline. Farmers are responsible for implementing the practical changes discussed at events like COP28 that will improve the sustainability of agriculture.\\n\\n\\nBut farmers are also contending with evolving and increasingly unpredictable conditions, especially those in regions hardest hit by climate change. More than \\n have died during the ongoing and unprecedented drought across the Horn of Africa. It can take \\n for farmers to recover from these losses if at all, according to UN reports.\\n\\n\\nA session on putting farmers first highlighted how existing adaptation efforts and support fall short. With escalating climate risks, urgent action is needed to expedite financing and implement climate change actions in agri-food and livestock systems, both to reduce emissions and ensure food and nutrition security.\\n\\n\\nThe voice of Africa: a new narrative for livestock on the continent\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe conversation around livestock systems remains polarized and lacks nuance. This is particularly true when talking about livestock systems in Africa. Livestock production plays a critical role in livelihoods, nutrition and climate adaptation across diverse production systems in Africa, and has the potential to contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and Africa’s Agenda 2063 Developmental Goals. This is quite different from how livestock systems are perceived and managed in the Global North.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe prevailing “meat and milk are bad” narrative frequently lumps livestock farmers in the developing world – most of whom practice low-input systems of production – with industrial and highly intensive farming systems in the\\xa0 Global North.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe session on Creating a New Livestock Narrative for Africa: the Role of Resilience in Livestock Systems highlighted the critical role of livestock in Africa’s livelihoods, nutrition, and its capacity for climate change adaptation. It described how sustainable livestock production practices can assist African countries in achieving their developmental goals while adhering to environmental limits.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nGeorge Wamukoya, Director of the African Groups of Negotiators Expert Support (AGNES), outlined how this narrative has muddled negotiators’ ability to talk about livestock in Africa. “In the negotiations,\\xa0it became\\xa0clear that many don;t understand livestock in Africa,” he said.\\xa0“In Africa, livestock is\\xa0tied to livelihood, culture and many things.”\\n\\n\\nOne message was clear above all others at the climate talks: the challenges of food security and climate change are inextricably linked. The world cannot rein in climate change without transforming food systems, but in doing so, governments must also safeguard food, nutrition and economic security for farmers and consumers around the world. Solving this dilemma is essential to the future of the planet and the entire population.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'preprocessed-text': \"meat matter livestock fare cop year in cop climate talk dual first make food agriculture explicit priority preside food agriculture water medic that day sever pavilion summit open country sign sustain agriculture resile food system climate action linkage global food system climate change become increasingly clear urgent mount evil show way country produce consume dispose food gene around greenhouse a miss drive global temperature country expect global south also face reality higher temperature errant rainfall climate extreme turn make farm increasingly difficult threaten food secure livelihood govern therefor face challenge need rapidly reduce agriculture miss time ensure farmer produce enough health safe afford food meet grow demand aim agriculture play particularly significs role race climateresili food system global livestock sector swim response direct indirect greenhouse a miss per cent methane region africa livestock animalsourc food lower environment footprint offer vital climate resile heat drought climate shock also reduce nutrient deficit rural poverty slew side event panel discus session clear climate debt must care nuance posit aim agriculture ensure vital benefit offer expect develop country compromise race net zero food choice privilege come product consult nutria health one thing clear global north global south food system need climate fund differ slut takeaway great food debt let talk convey intern livestock research institute prove action toward develop sustain food system must leave behind ruler consume climate action must therefor conoid social justice include child global north present unhealthy process food well global south unable access balance diet reduce overconsumpt meat develop country would improve diet reduce agriculture miss africa pastoralist play vital role produce contain meat milk daily glass help child develop physic count climate finance police must therefor take account best support differ outcome shift diet highincom country enable pastoralist adapt climate change into like indexes insure improve livestock feed climate winner loser within question climate justice question dietary justice raise issue power voice session achieve climate nutria goal aim agriculture vision maduekeh global alliance future food outline six guide principal conoid debt merit plants diet versus animalsourc food include put farmer first discus transform food system climate crisis often omit frontline farmer response implement practice change discus event like cop improve sustain agriculture farmer also contend evolve increasingly predict conduit expect region hardest hit climate change die onto unpriced drought across horn africa take farmer recon loss accord in report session put farmer first highlight exist adapt effort support fall short mescal climate risk urgent action need expedite finance implement climate change action agrifood livestock system reduce miss ensure food nutria secure voice africa new narc livestock contain covers around livestock system remain polar lack nuance particularly true talk livestock system africa livestock product play critic role livelihood nutria climate adapt across diver product system africa potent contribute achieve sustain develop goal africa agenda development goal quit differ livestock system perceive manage global north prevail meat milk bad narc frequent lump livestock farmer develop world practice lowinput system product industry highly intend farm system global north session great new livestock narc africa role resile livestock system highlight critic role livestock africa livelihood nutria calpac climate change adapt describe sustain livestock product practice assist african country achieve development goal adhere environment limit glory wamukoya director african group negate expert support an outline narc muddy negate bail talk livestock africa negate became clear man don't understand livestock africa said africa livestock tie livelihood culture man thing one message clear other climate talk challenge food secure climate change inextric link world cannot rein climate change without transform food system govern must also safeguard food nutria economy secure farmer consume around world sold dilemma essential future planet entire soul\", 'len-raw-text': 983, 'len-preprocessed-text': 605}, {'_id': ObjectId('669e694ce1d7257711209d55'), 'url': 'https://www.newfoodmagazine.com/article/196895/chefs-and-cultured-meat-a-recipe-for-culinary-revolution/', 'category': 'Food', 'title': 'Chefs and cultured meat: A recipe for culinary revolution', 'text': '\\n\\nChefs and cultured meat: A recipe for culinary revolution\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe 2023 Cultured Meat Symposium (\\n) took place on November 2-3, 2023 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Historically in San Francisco, the Cultured Meat Symposium is an annual gathering of industry leaders that discuss the future of cell-cultured meat and seafood technologies.\\n\\n\\nThis year’s theme was product development and manufacturing. Topics included process improvements, commercial scalability, hybrid products, AI automation, fundraising, government regulations, and my favourite, “Culinary Innovation: Exploring Cultured Meat with a Chef,” the title of my keynote presentation that started the second day of CMS23.\\n\\n\\nIn this article I will be sharing my key takeaways and examples of long-term strategies that excite the food industry.\\n\\n\\nChefs are first-to-market trend setters\\n\\n\\nMore than simply what is trending, chefs are innovators who speak on the plate and continuously think about what is next. Often chefs have thought of how to make an innovative ingredient or sustainable product taste great before anyone else. One example is ten years ago a 3-Michelin star restaurant called Manresa in Los Gatos, California served a cauliflower risotto.\\n\\n\\nShortly thereafter, cauliflower started to appear on the center of the plates across several fine-dining restaurants. Now the cauliflower trend has scaled to what seems to be every aisle of the grocery store—from rice to pizza to buffalo wings, among other categories. We also saw this with other vegetables like kale.\\n\\n\\nMore recently, David Chang put the Impossible burger on his single-restaurant menu in 2016. Now the Impossible meat is in over 45,000 locations globally.\\n\\n\\nConsumers trust chefs, and that can support cultured meat companies\\n\\n\\nSince chefs have been setting the trends before mass consumer adoption, chefs are data points before any quantitative data exists. They sit in the middle of our giant food system as thought leaders and translators people trust.\\n\\n\\nAccordingly, chefs are the people who have power over our food system and can shape not only how we eat, but also our climate future. Many even have access to their city officials and policymakers who dine at their restaurants—which can be an important regulatory asset.\\n\\n\\nEqually, cultured meat companies can support chefs\\n\\n\\nChefs have a powerful voice that inspires consumer habits, but there is only so much chefs (or anyone) can do on a restaurant plate each night.\\n\\n\\nRight now chefs want to figure out how to have an impact beyond the traditional “back-of-the-house” kitchen; and right now we need leaders in to culinary industry to step up to do more than plate a small number of dishes each service. Serving a unique, cultured meat product can increase foot traffic, visibility, position chefs as a trend setting sustainability thought leader, and provide multiple business lines for restaurants. This is especially relevant now as restaurants all over are closing—including David Chang’s Two Michelin star Momofuku Ko.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOffering cultured meat can broaden or even better engage high-end clientele to a restaurant community for their next luxury dining experience. One example I gave was having a “bites” menu section that would increase check averages. Another example is to start with a limited time offer. Cultured meat companies can then have a marketing campaign that adds customers and proves serving cultured meat is a strong value proposition that increases revenue. Even if not with a Michelin star chef, building a playbook with lower stake chef-partners will make launching future partnerships more successful.\\n\\n\\nAs CMS23 guest Kaitlin Grady, Director of Strategic Partnerships and Public Affairs, Clever Carnivore, Inc, Shared: “Chef engagement has been top of mind for Clever Carnivore as we develop our prototype products, and Philip’s presentation provided practical tools for fostering this crucial partnership. This takeaway especially resonated: “Chefs are uniquely positioned to share what matters and why.”\\n\\n\\nCo-innovation partnership\\n\\n\\nChefs and cultured meat companies can form co-innovation partnerships that enable a more rapid and successful market entry. Cultured meat companies can hire chefs as an “R&D Culinary Consultant” to test their product on restaurant menus for live feedback, and chefs can continuously improve the product from there. Restaurants can be a consumer testing ground, a real-world sensory panel. This is especially valuable for restaurants if they conducted this as a ticketed event on their slowest business days of the week. Long-term, this early R&D could lead to a smoother commercialisation path and more refined product, be it better in taste, new SKUs, different flavors, form factors, or cost effectiveness.\\n\\n\\nOne of the CMS23 producers summarised: “Philip’s presentation at the Cultured Meat Symposium was eye-opening to many in the cultivated meat industry,” said Anita Broellochs, Producer at SVCMS and Founder of Balletic Foods.\\n\\n\\n“Considering every company will have to go to market initially with a blended product, Philip highlighted how chefs can be involved from the very start ensuring the end product is something that consumers will seek out, whether that’s because of taste, accessibility, nutritional value, or presentation of the product. It was truly inspiring to hear thoughts from a chef firsthand and learn how companies can get started in collaborating with a chef.”\\n\\n\\nCulinary directions\\xa0\\n\\n\\nChefs need creative freedom with cultured meat. One of the CMS23 topics was that companies will have to enter the market with hybrid end products that use their cultured meat as an ingredient in a total formulation. This is an exciting opportunity for chefs who love innovation. They could add miso, caramelised onions, and black garlic to cultured beef, stuff charcoal-smoked garlic rice into cultured chicken wrapped in crispy yuba skin, or add roasted porcini mushrooms to cultured seafood, as examples.\\n\\n\\nIn addition to blended products, there are four culinary directions for chefs:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChefs as innovators, advocates and trendsetters\\n\\n\\nChefs are major stakeholders in the future of food and will be a key ingredient in making cultured meat and seafood a craveable eating experience for consumers. To quote one chef attendee:\\n\\n\\n“As a chef, my main take away from CMS23 is the need for collaborative innovation between scientists and chefs. While the replication of farm-raised meat taste and texture is vital, these principles will come in time as cultured meat is more readily available. The more that cultured meat companies realize the role chefs play as trusted translators of culinary arts and science, the more culturally acceptable cultured meat will become,” said Kevin Markey, Ph.D Candidate and Teaching Assistant, Foods Lab Department of Nutrition & Food Science, and Synergy Grant, Engineered Biomaterials Research Lab, University of Vermont\\n\\n\\nWhat if cultured meat was the new cauliflower?

According to the \\n, 58 percent of restaurant operators are pinning hopes on the technology to help alleviate labor shortages this year.\\n\\n\\nMajor fast food chains nationwide are launching AI deployments across select locations to help automate customer service and reduce the reliance on human labor. Chains like Popeyes, Panera Bread, Taco Bell, and more are testing CAI and GAI at the drive-thru to help automate and streamline ordering. However, the successful scaling of these initiatives hinges on their effectiveness. There have been instances of fast food chains introducing automated drive-thru order-taking that unintentionally frustrated customers due to inaccuracies and repetitive use of upselling.\\n\\n\\nIn the food business, the customer experience carries great significance. This is especially true for drive-thru and off-premise dining, where the customer’s objective is to get in and out quickly, with exactly what they ordered. When AI drive-thru virtual assistants get their order wrong, or attempt to upsell too frequently, customers are likely to leave dissatisfied.\\n\\n\\nAI, when implemented properly and intelligently, can greatly assist restaurant operations. Below are four main areas where the food service industry can utilise CAI and GAI solutions:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile these use cases are promising, food chains need to consider the following for AI to truly enhance the overall customer experience:\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAI should be conversational, not scripted\\n\\n\\nHumans are comfortable with natural language, so for AI implementations to be effective in food service, they must be genuinely conversational. Legacy chatbot systems may have limitations that often follow hard coded, scripted conversation. They may be incapable of handling complex customer orders and delivering accurate responses in real-time, which defeats the purpose of ‘fast food’.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor example, in a drive-thru ordering scenario, the customer may interrupt the AI virtual assistant to ask a question about adding an ingredient, change the order or ask about promotions. The virtual assistant must be ready and able to properly pivot and maintain the context of the conversation – if it is unable to handle interruptions from customers, it has not been integrated effectively. Simply put, if the AI can’t handle an interruption or answer a question, it’s not so intelligent.\\n\\n\\nHyperpersonalisation is key\\n\\n\\nAI in food service should be capable of emulating human responses with empathy and context-awareness. It is important for it to automatically adapt its vocabulary and language to match the user demographics, and respond to changes in customer voice tone, facial expressions, sentiments, and body language. This ability enables the AI to create tailored interactions, offering personalised menus, services, and solutions based on the users’ unique voice traits, sentiment and patterns.\\n\\n\\nMachine Learning (ML) plays a crucial role here, using special algorithms, features, and datasets that continually learn and adapt through experience. As they receive more input data, CAI and GAI systems improve their pattern recognition abilities, utilising this knowledge to make predictions and deliver more accurate outcomes in quick timeframes.\\n\\n\\nThere is a time and a place for upselling\\n\\n\\nThere are many challenges and nuances of upselling in any sales environment. In the context of AI-driven interactions in the food industry, the drive-thru is a place for convenience and timely service. While upselling may be good for the business’ bottom line, ill-timed offers from a worker or an AI agent can result in customer dissatisfaction.\\n\\n\\nFor upselling to be effective, virtual assistants need to exhibit human-like intelligence to make informed decisions about when to upsell. For example, if a customer orders a fish sandwich, and the AI asks if they’d like to upgrade to a meal, and the customer replies ‘yes,’ the customer is now already aware that they can upgrade to a meal. In this case, an intelligent, nuanced decision would be to not upsell the next item.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen done right, consistent and nuanced upselling is an advantage of AI over human workers. The overall goal is to avoid robotic, repetitive upselling approaches and instead offer a more personalised and effective strategy.\\n\\n\\nProper CAI solutions will revolutionise the food industry\\n\\n\\nFrom self-service kiosks to drive-thru automation and customer service support, there is immense potential for conversational and generative AI solutions in the foodservice industry. However, its success hinges on its ability to engage in genuinely conversational interactions, offer tailored services and implement personalised and effective upselling strategies.\\n\\n\\nWhen the proper AI solutions are implemented, they can revolutionise the foodservice industry, streamlining operations and improving customer satisfaction and loyalty.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'preprocessed-text': 'ai enhance disrupt fast food industry world quickly shift toward first framework food beverage industry embrace cuttingedg technology like covers ai can gene ai gas reshape future food service accord percent restart over pin hope technology help alley labor shortage year major fast food chain nationwide launch ai deploy across select local help auto custom service reduce reliant human labor chain like pope paper bread taco bell test can gas drivethru help auto streamline order how success scale inti thing effect instant fast food chain introduce auto drivethru ordertak intent frustrate custom due inaccuracy repeat use upset food busy custom expert carry great significs expect true drivethru offpremis dine custom object get quickly exactly order ai drivethru virtual assist get order wrong attempt upset frequent custom like leave dissatisfy ai implement properly intellig greatly assist restart over four main area food service industry utility can gas slut use case promise food chain need conoid follow ai truly enhance overall custom expert ai covers script human comfort nature language ai implement effect food service must genuine covers legacy chariot system may limit often follow hard code script covers may uncap hands complex custom order deli occur response reality defeat purpose fast food example drivethru order scenario custom may interrupt ai virtual assist ask question ad inbred change order ask promote virtual assist must ready all properly pivot maintain context covers unable hands interrupt custom inter effect simple put ai cannot hands interrupt answer question intellig hyperpersonalis key ai food service capable emu human response empathy contextawar import automat adapt vocabulary language match user demography respond change custom voice tone facial express sentiment body language bail enable ai great tailor interact offer personals menu service slut base user unique voice trait sentiment pattern machine learn my play crucial role use special algorithm feature dataset continue learn adapt expert receive input data can gas system improve pattern recognize bail utility knowledge make predict deli occur outcome quick timefram time place upset man challenge nuance upset sale environ context driven interact food industry drivethru place convent time service upset may good busy bottom line illtim offer worker ai agent result custom dissatisfact upset effect virtual assist need exhibit humanly intellig make inform decks upset example custom order fish sandwich ai ask would like upgrade meal custom reply ye custom already away upgrade meal case intellig nuance decks would upset next item done right consist nuance upset advantage ai human worker overall goal avoid robot repeat upset approach instead offer personals effect strategy proper can slut revolutions food industry selfservic kiosk drivethru auto custom service support immense potent covers gene ai slut foodservic industry how success thing bail engage genuine covers interact offer tailor service implement personals effect upset strategy proper ai slut implement revolutions foodservic industry streamline over improve custom satisfact loyalty', 'len-raw-text': 767, 'len-preprocessed-text': 468}, {'_id': ObjectId('669e6961e1d7257711209d58'), 'url': 'https://www.newfoodmagazine.com/article/222086/changing-appetites-adapting-to-evolving-tastes-in-processed-foods/', 'category': 'Food', 'title': 'Changing appetites: Adapting to evolving tastes in processed foods', 'text': '\\n\\nChanging appetites: Adapting to evolving tastes in processed foods\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlarm bells are ringing across the UK food landscape. Despite being one of Europe’s top consumers of ultra-processed foods (UPFs), with \\n from this category, consumer attitudes are changing.\\n\\n\\nRecent reports, such as Mintel’s \\n, point to a growing tide of concern and a shift towards healthier options. As Mintel’s Director Alex Beckett notes, “Our research reveals a clear trend: 70 percent of UK adults actively try to avoid UPFs.”\\n\\n\\nThis shift does not, however, come without challenges. Consumer confusion reigns supreme: many struggle to identify UPFs lurking in their everyday diets. Surveys highlight this dilemma, with a YouGov study commissioned by the\\n showing that while awareness of UPFs has increased (46 percent vs 30 percent in 2021), so has the difficulty in pinpointing them (61 percent agree clear labelling would be helpful).\\n\\n\\nThe growing concern over UPFs presents both a challenge and an opportunity for the food industry. While confusion may cloud the path for some consumers, the underlying message is clear: customers prioritise healthier, less processed options, and prefer making informed food choices.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWhat exactly are ultra-processed foods?\\n\\n\\nThe term broadly refers to foods that have five or more ingredients and include additives not typically used in home cooking. These additives include preservatives, emulsifiers, sweeteners, and artificial colours and flavours.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\nExamples of ultra-processed foods that you might find on the shelves of your local supermarket include ice cream, sausages, crisps, flavoured yoghurts, mass-produced bread, biscuits, and fizzy drinks. Some alcoholic drinks, including whisky, gin, and rum, may also fall into the ultra-processed category.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA growing body of evidence shows that the increased consumption of these kinds of foods has \\n in the obesity epidemic that plagues the world. That’s because they tend to be higher in calories and lower in nutrition than their processed or unprocessed equivalents. There are \\n associated with these kinds of foods too, including cancer, heart disease, and depression.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe top five foods that people thought were classed as ultra-processed from a list in the recent BNF survey were:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, fewer people classified baked beans (9 percent), low-fat fruit yoghurts (10 percent), ice cream (14 percent), and sliced bread (19 percent) as ultra-processed.\\n\\n\\nIt’s understandable why people eat ultra-processed foods. They’re frequently cheaper and more convenient than their unprocessed and processed counterparts and have long shelf lives, making them feel even more cost effective. But we are seeing a growing desire for customers to reduce their consumption of UPFs or avoid them altogether, instead pursuing healthier alternatives, so how should the industry respond to this consumer confusion?\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nEmbracing transparency and catering to healthier options\\n\\n\\nConsumer priorities are shifting. Transparency and health are rising to the top of the food agenda. The industry must adapt to thrive and ensure consumers get quality products. Gone are the days of opaque ingredient lists and sugar-laden enticements. Clear and accessible labelling and nutrient-rich options are now the keys to building trust and addressing consumer confusion.\\n\\n\\nThis doesn’t mean abandoning convenience but expanding offerings to include minimally processed choices that align with evolving preferences. Beyond this, there needs to be a wider push for promoting nutritionally complete, whole foods to address consumer confusion and the growing demand for healthier choices.\\n\\n\\nConsumers shouldn’t have to sacrifice convenience, scouring every label or hunting down specialist retailers to make these changes either. It’s something we firmly believe at \\n. That’s why we stock more than 4,000 healthy groceries for all diets and lifestyles and we also have a wide variety of resources aimed at helping people find the ingredients most beneficial to the lifestyle they want to lead.\\n\\n\\nThe food industry’s future hinges on its ability to adapt to the evolving consumer attitudes towards ultra-processed foods and the desire to see more nutritionally complete foods on shelves. By prioritising transparency, diversifying offerings and investing in healthier options, the industry can satisfy consumer needs for better communicated and healthier, more accessible food choices.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'preprocessed-text': 'change appetite adapt evolve last process food alarm bell ring across up food landscape despite one euros top consume ultraprocess food up category consume attitude change recent report minted point grow tide concern shift toward healthier option minted director ale becket note research reveal clear trend percent up adult active try avoid up shift how come without challenge consume confuse reign supreme man struggle identify up lurk everyday diet survey highlight dilemma yougov study commits show away up increase percent v percent difficult pinpoint percent are clear label would help grow concern up present challenge opportune food industry confuse may cloud path consume underlie message clear custom priorities healthier we process option prefer make inform food choice exactly ultraprocess food term broadly refer food five inbred include admit topic use home cook admit include preserve emulsify sweeten artifice color flavor example ultraprocess food might find shell local supermarket include ice cream sausage crisp flavor yoghurt massproduc bread biscuit fizzy drink alcohol drink include whisky gin rum may also fall ultraprocess category grow body evil show increase consult kind food ones spider plague world tend higher calorie lower nutria process process equal cassock kind food include cancer heart disease depress top five food people thought class ultraprocess list recent and survey how fewer people classify bake bean percent lowest fruit yoghurt percent ice cream percent slice bread percent ultraprocess understand people eat ultraprocess food frequent cheaper convent process process counterpart long shelf live make feel even cost effect see grow desire custom reduce consult up avoid altogether instead pursue healthier alter industry respond consume confuse embrace transfer cater healthier option consume priority shift transfer health rise top food agenda industry must adapt thrive ensure consume get quality product gone day opaque inbred list sugarladen entice clear access label nutrientrich option key build trust address consume confuse mean abandon convent expand offer include minim process choice align evolve prefer beyond need wider push promote nutria complete whole food address consume confuse grow demand healthier choice consume sacrifice convent scour ever label hunt specialist retail make change either some firmly believe stock health grocery diet lifestyle also wide variety resource aim help people find inbred benefic lifestyle want lead food industry future thing bail adapt evolve consume attitude toward ultraprocess food desire see nutria complete food shell priorities transfer diversify offer invest healthier option industry satisfy consume need better common healthier access food choice', 'len-raw-text': 656, 'len-preprocessed-text': 401}, {'_id': ObjectId('669e6965e1d7257711209d59'), 'url': 'https://www.newfoodmagazine.com/article/221466/stepping-up-to-the-plate-nick-stevens/', 'category': 'Food', 'title': 'Stepping up to the plate: Nick Stevens', 'text': '\\n\\nStepping up to the plate: Nick Stevens\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe coffee sector is booming. In fact, Statista predicts that the coffee market worldwide is projected to grow by \\n between 2024 and 2028.\\n\\n\\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of the coffee sector, leadership and innovation crucial roles in shaping the industry’s future. Nick Stevens, the newly appointed B2B Commercial Director for Nespresso Professional in the UK and Republic of Ireland, sits down with New Food to discuss his seven years worth of experience within the company, delving into his background, insights and vision for Nespresso Professional.\\n\\n\\nWho are you and what is your new role?\\n\\n\\nNick Stevens, I’m the newly appointed B2B Commercial Director for Nespresso Professional in the UK and Republic of Ireland (ROI).\\n\\n\\nWhat experience do you have in the sector?\\n\\n\\nI have been at Nespresso Professional for nearly seven years – I love this team and I’m excited for the new challenge. I am looking forward to this fun and new chapter growing the B2B division across various commercial areas including HORECA and Office commerce. I moved to Nespresso in 2017 from Nestle Waters where I held responsibility for the HORECA channel, where I worked for over three years. Prior to this, I worked in the hotel industry as a director in sales and marketing, where I was responsible across revenue, marketing, and partnership sectors of the businesses. My previous experience also includes time at the Morgans Hotel Group and The May Fair Hotel.\\n\\n\\nAfter nearly seven years at Nespresso, what have you learnt about the coffee sector?\\n\\n\\nThe coffee sector is always changing and advancing. For businesses looking to keep their employees and their customers happy, good coffee is no longer just a ‘nice to have’. Our sustainability journey is decades old at Nespresso, but everyone is now more conscious of the urgent need to act to protect our planet. Whether you are managing a FTSE 100 office, an independent retail business, a golf club or an international hotel, every business is under pressure to act more sustainably – whilst maintaining standards.\\n\\n\\nWhat is something that Nespresso Professional is working on right now that really excites you?\\n\\n\\nAt Nespresso Professional we are currently working on the new launch of our Brazil Organic coffee to add to our Origins range. The capsule will join the collection which has flavours from Peru, Congo, and Colombia. All the coffees in this range are ‘Made with Care’ and sourced from carefully selected regions in each of these countries.\\n\\n\\nWe are also exploring new partnerships and products. I can’t share much right now, but there are lots of exciting things coming down the track this year – new blends, new recipes, new innovations. The expansion of our Professional range and presence is something really important to me and my team.\\n\\n\\nTell me one recent news story that has stood out to you in recent months concerning food and beverage and why?\\n\\n\\nOne story that has really stood out to me was a programme that asked, “\\n ‘Third spaces’ are communal, socialising places like coffee shops and the benefits they can bring to communities and individuals is fascinating.\\n\\n\\nNespresso Professional recently did some research into why office workers are adopting a ‘work from anywhere’ approach; opting to work from cafés, libraries, hotels, or even bars! We discovered that people find these environments inspiring and productive.\\n\\n\\nI personally love spending time at the office with my team – it is invaluable. If you are someone with the opportunity to work flexibly, though, why not pop into a local venue and grab a sandwich or a coffee whilst you work? That support could make all the difference and many in the HORECA industry are already starting to create bespoke offerings.\\n\\n\\nWhat are your visions for your new role at the time of stepping up?\\n\\n\\nWhere to start? As someone that has come up through the industry and been at Nespresso for years, I never want to lose sight of how important our customer experience is. I love getting out and meeting our partners; learning what makes them tick. I’m quite straight-talking and the people side of the business is something I am passionate about. Hopefully that openness and my genuine passion for this team and this business will shine through.\\n\\n\\nAt the same time, I am focused on spotting new opportunities – we can tailor our offering to businesses of any size, in any sector, and that is exciting as we expand. There are lots of innovations in the pipeline that I can’t wait to bring to life.\\n\\n\\nHow to do see the coffee sector evolving in the next three years?\\n\\n\\nA great question! I’m optimistic about coffee as a force for good. I think we’ll see new innovations that reduce the sector’s negative impact on the environment and a concerted effort across the board to move towards regenerative and socially responsible practices.\\n\\n\\nThe creativity that people apply to their coffee isn’t going away. It’s hard to believe that pumpkin spice or Matcha were once unusual here in the UK, but they were! We’re seeing new blends that bring surprising flavour combinations to the fore and I can’t wait to see what’s next.\\n\\n\\nWhat is one trend you believe will take the sector by storm in 2024?\\n\\n\\nOur understanding of the health and wellbeing benefits of coffee is improving every year. The ties between wellness and coffee will only strengthen further – and that’s an opportunity for the sector.\\n\\n\\nWe are already seeing some combine ingredients like mushrooms, protein, and collagen with their coffees. At Nespresso, we recently launched Ginseng Delight and Vivida B12 for consumers to enjoy at home. But we’re only at the tip of the iceberg when it comes to this trend – watch this space because wellness is certainly going to take the sector by storm!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'preprocessed-text': 'step plate nick seven coffee sector boom fact statist predict coffee market worldwide project grow everevolv landscape coffee sector leadership into crucial role shape industry future nick seven newly appoint be commerce director espresso profession up republic ireland sit new food discus seven year worth expert within company deli background insight vision espresso profession new role nick seven newly appoint be commerce director espresso profession up republic ireland rob expert sector espresso profession nearly seven year love team exit new challenge look forward fun new chapter grow be dives across various commerce area include orca office commerce move espresso nest water held response orca channel work three year prior work hotel industry director sale market response across revenue market partnership sector busy previous expert also include time organ hotel group may fair hotel nearly seven year espresso learnt coffee sector coffee sector always change advance busy look keep employe custom happy good coffee longer nice sustain journey dead old espresso everyone conscious urgent need act protect planet whether manage fuse office indeed retail busy golf club intern hotel ever busy pressure act sustain whilst maintain standard some espresso profession work right really exit espresso profession current work new launch brazil organ coffee add origin rang capsule join collect flavor peru congo colombia coffee rang made care source care select region country also explore new partnership product cannot share much right lot exit thing come track year new blend new recipe new into expand profession rang present some really import team tell one recent news story stood recent month concern food beverage one story really stood program ask third space common socialist place like coffee shop benefit bring common individual fascia espresso profession recent research office worker adopt work anywhere approach opt work came library hotel even bar disco people find environ inspire product person love spend time office team invade someone opportune work flexible though pop local menu grab sandwich coffee whilst work support could make differ man orca industry already start great bespoke offer vision new role time step start someone come industry espresso year never want lose sight import custom expert love get meet partner learn make tick quit straighttalk people side busy some passion hope open genuine passion team busy shine time focus spot new opportune tailor offer busy size sector exit expand lot into pipeline cannot wait bring life see coffee sector evolve next three year great question optimist coffee for good think see new into reduce sector new impact environ concert effort across board move toward regent social response practice creative people apply coffee go away hard believe pumpkin spice match unusual up see new blend bring surprise flavor combine fore cannot wait see next one trend believe take sector storm understand health well benefit coffee improve ever year tie well coffee strengthen opportune sector already see combine inbred like mushroom protein collagen coffee espresso recent launch ginseng delight vivid b consume enjoy home tip iceberg come trend watch space well certainly go take sector storm', 'len-raw-text': 972, 'len-preprocessed-text': 501}, {'_id': ObjectId('669e696ee1d7257711209d5a'), 'url': 'https://www.newfoodmagazine.com/article/228923/navigating-the-canned-cocktail-revolution/', 'category': 'Food', 'title': 'Navigating the canned cocktail revolution', 'text': '\\n\\nNavigating the canned cocktail revolution\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the dynamic landscape of the beverage industry, the past five years have witnessed a notable transformation – the rise of canned cocktails. This shift underscores changing consumer preferences, marked by a growing demand for convenience, quality, and sustainability. As a brand turning the dial in this evolving market, my Co-Founder and I have gained valuable insights into the forces driving this revolution and the innovative strategies employed to meet consumer demands.\\n\\n\\n, our tequila cocktail brand, stands as a testament to this shift. Our journey began with a vision to bring the exclusive experience of finely crafted cocktails, typically savoured in member’s clubs, to the comfort of consumers’ homes. Rooted in a commitment to quality and sustainability, our cocktails are crafted from premium tequila and natural ingredients, with a mission to redefine the way consumers enjoy tequila through a range of highly convenient formats.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nBecoming mainstream\\n\\n\\nThe emergence of canned cocktails represents a departure from traditional norms, offering consumers the convenience of pre-mixed, ready-to-drink beverages without compromising on taste or quality. The canned cocktail revolution can be traced back to the early 2010s, with its origins rooted in the broader trend of convenience and experiential consumption. While cocktails in cans have been around for decades, it was during this time that they began to gain traction as a mainstream beverage choice.\\n\\n\\nSeveral factors contributed to the rise of canned cocktails. Firstly, there was a growing demand for ready-to-drink options that offered convenience without compromising on quality or taste. Busy lifestyles and an increasing desire for on-the-go experiences prompted consumers to seek out alternatives to traditional cocktails, which often required time-consuming preparation. Their lightweight and portable nature allow consumers to enjoy them anytime and anywhere.\\n\\n\\nAdditionally, canned cocktails have emerged as a beacon of sustainability in the realm of beverages for several reasons. Firstly, their infinitely recyclable nature significantly reduces waste and minimises environmental impact. Secondly, their production and transportation entail a lower carbon footprint compared to bottled alternatives like glass. And what’s more, the design of cans prevents sunlight from infiltrating, ensuring that cocktails retain freshness over time.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvancements in flavour innovation and high abv options have played a crucial role in driving the popularity of canned cocktails, enticing a broader audience to try them for the first time. Brands began to experiment with new flavour combinations and premium ingredients, challenging the notion that canned beverages were inferior or weaker than\\xa0 their freshly-made counterparts. As a result, consumers became more open to trying canned cocktails as a convenient and enjoyable alternative to traditional mixed drinks.\\n\\n\\nThe rise of social media and digital platforms helped to fuel interest in canned cocktails, with brands leveraging these channels to showcase their products, engage with consumers and collaborate with other brands in a more accessible way than ever. The visual appeal of canned cocktails, combined with their convenience and portability, made them a popular choice for social gatherings and outdoor events and festivals.\\n\\n\\nThe canned cocktail revolution can be seen as a natural evolution of consumer preferences towards convenience, quality, and sustainability. As consumers continue to seek out convenient and innovative beverage options, the market for canned cocktails is likely to continue its growth trajectory, offering consumers a diverse array of premium, ready-to-drink options to enjoy on any occasion.\\n\\n\\nCreating in a crowded market\\n\\n\\nAt Pimentae, we recognised this burgeoning trend early on and seized the opportunity to innovate within the space. Our ‘Pocket of Paradise’ collection, featuring cocktails like the Spicy Margarita, Tommy’s Margarita and Cucumber Margarita, embodies our commitment to crafting cocktails that offer quality, captivate the senses and provide the convenience consumers crave.\\n\\n\\nBehind the scenes, the innovation process is a collaborative effort that spans flavour development, ingredient sourcing, and packaging design. Drawing on our expertise and industry insights, we curate each element to ensure it resonates with consumer preferences and stands out in a crowded market. From the selection of premium spirits to the incorporation of natural flavourings and botanicals, every decision is guided by our dedication to quality and authenticity.\\n\\n\\nAs consumer palates become more discerning, there is a growing appetite for unique and more sophisticated flavours in cocktails. This presents an opportunity for brands like Pimentae to experiment with bold flavours and redefine the boundaries of traditional cocktail offerings. Our bestselling Spicy Margarita is the prime example of this. Crafting the perfect chilli extract that offered a delicate balance – delivering depth of flavour with just the right amount of heat, without overpowering the palate. Incorporating a blend of Jalapeno and Scotch Bonnet extracts, this cocktail has garnered widespread acclaim, even among those who typically say they dislike spice.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn an age where Instagram-worthy moments reign supreme, consumers are constantly on the lookout for products that not only taste good but also look aesthetically pleasing. Canned cocktails, with their sleek packaging and vibrant branding, have become the perfect accessory for social gatherings and virtual happy hours, allowing consumers to elevate their drinking experiences while sharing them with friends and followers online. Pimentae’s can range is wrapped in bespoke, hand-painted artwork that tells the story of the brand and the cocktails, consumers want more than just a cocktail, they want experience, feeling and brands that align to their values.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n“A cultural shift towards experimental consumption”\\n\\n\\nIt’s also worth recognising the broader industry trends that have contributed to this phenomenon.

potential to enhance food safety practices\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe journey towards integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into food safety practices marks a pivotal evolution in how the food industry manages hygiene and safety protocols. Historically, data on food safety is vast but very fragmented.\\n\\n\\nIt is often collected through traditional methods that create a lag in providing real-time insights that are necessary for proactive decision-making. However, with the steady implementation of digital transformation programmes across the food production sector, the landscape is shifting. With the increasing adoption of innovative hygiene inspection solutions that incorporate immediate data capture at the point of testing, we are starting to see a tangible pathway to access real time analytics to transform food safety culture from reactive to proactive.\\n\\n\\nIn this article, we will explore how technology, and the current trend of AI and machine learning, has the ability to redefine cleanliness standards across food production and retail sectors.\\n\\n\\nTapping into traditional limitations\\n\\n\\nTraditional hygiene testing practices in the food industry, such as microbiological culturing, ATP testing, and chemical indicators, do not typically give immediate results and require specialised equipment or training.\\n\\n\\nIn the scenario of a typical food contamination event, where a batch of products is found to be contaminated with \\n, the discovery triggers a cascade of reactive steps. This can include a public recall of the affected products, extensive media announcements to warn consumers, and a costly shutdown of production lines for deep cleaning and investigation. This approach not only incurs significant financial loss but can also damage a brand’s reputation and impact \\xa0consumer trust.\\n\\n\\nNavigating new horizons\\n\\n\\nBy embracing AI and machine learning to make sense of extensive data sets in food safety, we can now trace contamination sources, predict hygiene failures, and even anticipate disruptions within the supply chain.\\n\\n\\nYet, as we navigate this promising horizon, we encounter the critical need to balance innovation with data sensitivity. To bring stakeholders to the table robust encryption, stringent data access controls, and continuous security monitoring are critical to future success.\\n\\n\\nConnected data is an important step to predictive analytics and our industry must remain unwavering in our commitment to data privacy, regulation compliance, and the ethical use of technology.\\n\\n\\nAnonymous predictive power\\n\\n\\nMuch like the advancements seen in healthcare where AI has been instrumental in advancing treatments and predicting outbreaks, the transformative potential in food safety is underscored by its ability to leverage anonymized data for predictive analytics.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy applying similar principles, AI models in the food industry have the ability to forecast potential contamination and food safety breaches, enabling businesses to shift from a reactive to a proactive stance. By bringing together and analysing comprehensive data sets within one system, AI can detect sporadic contamination patterns and identify contamination harbourage points such as machine seals.\\n\\n\\nGoing further, this predictive insight can then be anonymously shared with the food industry to mitigate the same issue occurring for other businesses. These insights can further be refined by correlating with seasonal changes or shift times as more data is analysed, enabling predictions of specific bacterial presence, such as \\n in winter or \\n in summer.\\n\\n\\nAs AI continues to evolve, its role in enhancing traceability and transparency becomes increasingly critical, offering the ability to quickly trace back sources of contamination, thereby not only safeguarding public health but also protecting brand reputation.\\n\\n\\nOptimising supply chains\\n\\n\\nThe application of AI can also extend beyond prediction by playing a crucial role in optimising the supply chain for enhanced efficiency and safety. Through real-time monitoring and risk assessment, AI technologies offer a panoramic view of the supply chain, identifying bottlenecks and potential contamination sources before they become issues.\\n\\n\\nThis level of traceability and transparency was previously unattainable, marking a significant leap towards ensuring the integrity of food from farm to table. Such advancements not only facilitate quicker responses to contamination events but also contribute to a more sustainable and ethical food production system, reflecting a growing consumer demand for transparency.\\n\\n\\nAddressing the challenges\\n\\n\\nDespite the promising prospects of AI in food safety, there are challenges to its implementation, ranging from data privacy concerns to the need for a robust technological infrastructure. Ethical considerations also loom large, especially regarding how data is collected, shared, and used.\\n\\n\\nHowever, by adopting stringent data privacy standards and focusing on the development of ethical AI, the food industry can navigate these challenges. The establishment of a \\n, as seen in initiatives by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), points towards a collaborative approach in overcoming these obstacles.\\n\\n\\nFurther industry research completed by the European Parliamentary Research Service suggests building a \\n can be key to unlocking its full potential, paving the way for a future where food safety and quality are significantly enhanced through technology.\\n\\n\\nWorkforce and regulation\\n\\n\\nThe successful implementation of AI in food safety will require the industry to communicate and educate the workforce on the approaches and methods involved in utilising AI data, and acting on its recommendations.\\n\\n\\nTo allow the use of AI to expand effectively into the food industry, companies will need to communicate to their staff how to use new AI tools to enhance their day-to-day practises, rather than be seen as a nuisance. AI tools can help to empower staff at every level of a company, with managers being able to rapidly report and monitor sites, as well as sample collectors having the ability to rapidly act on any issues observed from their testing. Behavioural change is challenging, so there is a pressing need to hire professionals with expertise in data analytics, AI programming and system integration who can ensure that new data systems are implemented in a well communicated fashion, and meets all regulatory requirements.\\n\\n\\nOpting for a phased approach\\n\\n\\nRecognising the meticulous nature of the food industry, we believe a measured exploration of the potential benefits of AI can provide a clear route to adoption. A phased approach can enable enterprises to understand the benefits of AI while managing brand and reputational concerns.\\n\\n\\nCentral to this journey is addressing data privacy considerations through solid security measures and ethical data practices, ensuring that the adoption of AI enhances consumer trust rather than undermining it. Additionally, cultivating a skilled workforce adept in AI and data analytics, coupled with navigating regulatory landscapes, will be pivotal in overcoming implementation barriers.\\n\\n\\nThe pathway to adoption\\n\\n\\nLooking ahead, we envision a food industry that not only embraces AI for its operational benefits but also sees it as a catalyst for building a more transparent, safe, and efficient food supply chain. This future is not just about leveraging technology for the sake of innovation but about fostering a human culture of safety and quality that benefits all stakeholders through producers, consumers, and regulators alike. By approaching AI adoption with an open mind and a commitment to collaboration and continuous improvement, we can pave the way for a food industry that is not only more resilient to safety challenges but also more responsive to the evolving demands of a global consumer base.\\n\\n\\nThe more heterogeneous data that can be incorporated into AI models, from a range of sources including all sizes and types of food producers, restaurants and commercial kitchens through to regulators, the sharper an AI model can be in informing the entire food industry in predicting food safety trends and providing the most efficient routes to proactive food safety.\\n\\n\\nEmpowering safety\\n\\n\\nNew technology often fails to roll out when it is poorly understood by the user. AI must be seen and demonstrated to enhance a manager’s work process, empowering a safety auditor in their reporting and aiding a cleaner in proactively responding to a detected risk. When setting out on our mission to make contamination visible through a simple colour change technology test, making hygiene accessible to all levels of the food sector has been a central tenet of our vision. By working with industry partners combining simple and quick hygiene testing with cloud data solutions we firmly believe that AI can be used as a powerful tool to ensure the highest standards of food safety and quality, today and in the years to come.\\n\\n\\nTo find out more about the impact of AI in the food sector, listen to New Food’s two part podcast series on the applications of AI

For decades, the biggest selling cooking sauce in the UK was the Homepride tinned Curry Sauce, a product that made the company I worked for a huge amount of money. It was widely seen as old fashioned, inauthentic, cheap and poor quality, but consistently outperformed every other cooking sauce on the market.\\n\\n\\nThe funny thing was, every other Indian cooking sauce brand wanted to think of itself as premium, and all of them ended up fighting over a small segment of the market, offering authentic flavours, premium indulgence, and a restaurant experience at home. Whereas Homepride quietly provided a simple, cheap, family friendly product that people could rely on, and went about its business largely unchallenged by other brands.\\n\\n\\nI saw a similar thing happen during the explosion of vegan meat brands between 2019 and 2021. Dozens of shiny new players, some backed by food giants, others by venture capitalists, all with exciting new products and big marketing spends. And seemingly all of them were fighting at the premium end of the market, looking for a piece of the big spending millennials, interested in ethical consumerism from a funky lifestyle brand.\\n\\n\\nFast forward to 2023 and the on-rushing cost of living crisis was to plough straight into the super-premium plant-based market, leaving casualties strewn all over the tracks. Stretched consumers abandoned plant-based brands at the same time as costs were spiralling, putting many brands and manufacturers out of business. I cannot help thinking that if any of those brands had built themselves around offering consumers value, a cost-of-living crisis would have been their chance to shine. What we needed was a plant-based Homepride. What we got were a dozen wannabe Teslas.\\n\\n\\nOn the surface, there seems to be very little reason why plant-based should not be offering better value than meat. After all, most of the ingredients in plant-based meat products are similar to the constituents of animal feed. Can it really be cheaper and more efficient to feed soya to a pig and make a sausage out of that pig’s meat, than to make a sausage directly out of soya?\\n\\n\\nOur latest \\n set out to explore the reasons behind the price premium that plant-based seems to command and found a complex picture. The issue is not entirely down to the high margin expectations of highly leveraged vegan start-ups. Although soya protein is indeed cheaper than meat, the cost of turning that protein into something delicious and functional is what makes plant-based command a price premium.\\n\\n\\nOur analysis shows that flavours, gelling agents, emulsifiers and colours add considerable costs. And perhaps even more significant, the complexity of plant-based formulations, with so many additional steps and processes, creates huge wastage and inefficiency. Making a beef burger involves little more than mixing some meat with a seasoning pack and forming into shapes, whereas a plant-based equivalent often requires four or five steps, all of which take time and produce waste.\\n\\n\\nAdd to that the low volumes and short chilled shelf lives, and plant-based ends up being far more expensive to get on shelf. These inefficiencies left plant-based producers extremely vulnerable once the cost-of-living crisis started to bite, forcing them to cut already tight margins to chase volume, or have rates of sale drop so low that they risk being delisted. The fact that almost all of the new plant-based meat brands were premium options cannot have helped, as consumers were never likely to shop the fixture in search of value. It was a disaster that could have, and probably should have, been predicted.\\n\\n\\nOf course, the existence of a Homepride for plant-based meat is predicated on it being possible to offer value plant-based burgers and sausages that are high enough in quality. Even at the value end of a market, families demand delicious options and will turn their backs if brands don’t deliver. And although this challenge is difficult, our report shows that it is possible. There are various approaches at the ingredient level that can help manufacturers take significant costs out of formulations.\\n\\n\\nOptimising the use of flavourings is a key approach, as flavour can drive as much as 40 percent of the ingredient cost of many plant-based products. Switching to less processed protein concentrates, rather than expensive protein isolates is another way of taking out considerable cost and will also reduce the carbon impact of recipes. New methods of achieving meat-like structures are increasingly available, many of which are cleaner label and cheaper than conventional methylcellulose-based approaches. And finding ways of optimising the use of side streams from protein extraction is increasingly important, with the potential to dramatically bring down the cost of formulations.\\n\\n\\nPlant-based needs some concerted, incremental product development activity to bring down the cost of recipes, increasing profitability and most importantly, offering consumers some value options. If delicious plant-based burgers and nuggets are available that are comparable in price to meat, or preferably cheaper, then I have no doubt there would be considerable switching. Most consumers buy processed meat products in spite of the fact they are made from animals, not because of it. Provide something better that they can afford, and a lot of the barriers will come down.\\n\\n\\nWhilst many commenters consider the future of plant-based to be about precision fermentation and cellular agriculture, I think what it really needs is some boring, old-fashioned cost reduction. That might not generate as much investment cash as promising lab-grown meat by 2030, but it will probably have a much bigger impact on the food people eat.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'preprocessed-text': 'plant base find recipe success develop chef trade work man year develop recipe large cook sauce brand dead biggest sell cook sauce up homered tin curry sauce product made company work huge amount money wide seen old fashion inauthentic cheap poor quality consist outperform ever cook sauce market funny thing ever india cook sauce brand want think premium end fight small segment market offer authentic flavor premium indulge restart expert home where homered quietly provide simple cheap family friendly product people could rely went busy large unchallenged brand saw similar thing happen expos vegan meat brand dozen shine new player back food giant other venture capitalist exit new product big market spend seemingly fight premium end market look piece big spend millennia interest ethic consumer funky lifestyle brand fast forward onrush cost live crisis plough straight superpremium plants market leave casualty strewn track stretch consume abandon plants brand time cost spiral put man brand manufacture busy cannot help think brand built around offer consume value costofliv crisis would chance shine need plants homered got dozen wanna tesla surface seem little reason plants offer better value meat inbred plants meat product similar constitute aim feed really cheaper office feed soya pig make sausage pig meat make sausage directly soya latest set explore reason behind price premium plants seem command found complex picture issue entire high margin expect highly leverage vegan startup although soya protein index cheaper meat cost turn protein some delict function make plants command price premium analysis show flavor tell agent emulsify color add consider cost perhaps even significs complex plants formal man admit step process great huge wastage ineffici make beef burger involve little mix meat season pack form shape where plants equal often require four five step take time produce wast add low volume short chill shelf live plants end far expense get shelf ineffici left plants produce extreme ruler costofliv crisis start bite for cut already tight margin chase volume rate sale drop low risk desist fact almost new plants meat brand premium option cannot help consume never like shop fixture search value dicast could probably predict course exist homered plants meat predict possible offer value plants burger sausage high enough quality even value end market family demand delict option turn back brand deli although challenge difficult report show possible various approach inbred level help manufacture take significs cost formal optimism use flavor key approach flavor drive much percent inbred cost man plants product switch we process protein concent rather expense protein idol azoth way take consider cost also reduce carbon impact recipe new method achieve beatnik structure increasingly avail man cleaner label cheaper convent methylcellulosebas approach find way optimism use side stream protein extract increasingly import potent drama bring cost formal plants need concert increment product develop active bring cost recipe increase profit importantly offer consume value option delict plants burger nugget avail compare price meat prefer cheaper doubt would consider switch consume buy process meat product spite fact made aim provide some better afford lot barrier come whilst man comment conoid future plants precise ferment cellular agriculture think really need bore oldfashion cost reduce might gene much invest cash promise labgrown meat probably much bigger impact food people eat', 'len-raw-text': 946, 'len-preprocessed-text': 535}, {'_id': ObjectId('669e6983e1d7257711209d5e'), 'url': 'https://www.newfoodmagazine.com/article/227239/net-zero-farming-a-recipe-for-food-insecurity-in-the-uk/', 'category': 'Food', 'title': 'Net Zero farming: A recipe for food insecurity in the UK?', 'text': '\\n\\nNet Zero farming: A recipe for food insecurity in the UK?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe operation went well but the patient died”.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'preprocessed-text': 'net zero farm recipe food insecure up over went well patient die', 'len-raw-text': 19, 'len-preprocessed-text': 12}, {'_id': ObjectId('669e698ee1d7257711209d5f'), 'url': 'https://www.newfoodmagazine.com/article/225261/how-is-adm-moving-the-needle-when-it-comes-to-food-flavours/', 'category': 'Food', 'title': 'How is ADM moving the needle when it comes to food flavours?', 'text': '\\n\\nHow is ADM moving the needle when it comes to food flavours?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe food flavours sector is one of the biggest in the food and beverage industry, \\n.\\n\\n\\nWith a market of that kind of size and scale, being truly innovative is a huge challenge. Consumers have huge expectations when it comes to flavour, and therefore so do manufacturers and retailers. That pressure travels up the chain and lands with people such as Angela Barnard, Senior Flavourist Citrus, and Sunarie Servais, EMEA Director of Product Marketing, Flavours, both at ADM.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0spoke to Barnard and Servais to understand ADM’s new Corefold™ technology, the changes it has introduced to the flavour sector and the challenges they face in fulfilling often unrealistic demands from their consumers.\\n\\n\\nWhat is ADM’s Corefold™ technology?\\n\\n\\nDriven by demand for unique and differentiated citrus profiles, we have engineered Corefold™ citrus flavour technology to deliver refreshing citrus flavours that are captivating European consumers’ attention. Made possible through novel and proprietary separation technologies and concentration methods, Corefold™ focuses on the core part of citrus, emphasising the molecules responsible for impact and mouthfeel while capturing top notes for freshness and aroma.\\n\\n\\nIdeally suited across a wide range of beverage applications, Corefold™ can solve specific formulation challenges while delivering offerings that burst with crisp citrus flavours. For example, when used in flavoured water formulations, Corefold™ can deliver the needed body and mouthfeel that may be lost without juice or sugar content. Corefold™ also helps ensure citrus notes shine through beer bases, tantalising consumers’ tastebuds.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTaking citrus as an example, how do you create the classic citrus flavour which consumers think of?\\n\\n\\nFormulating authentic citrus flavours and ingredients requires the appropriate process technologies adapted to the desired end application. With our innovative citrus flavour systems and decades of flavour creation expertise, we use a combination of tools and strategies to accentuate the molecules that evoke the fresh citrus notes consumers expect.\\n\\n\\nOur flavourists use raw material strategies and captive technologies to maximise flavour creation flexibility across applications. These raw materials include peel oil, essence oil and water phase, each bringing different flavour characteristics, such as juicy or tangy. Utilising a combination of distillation and non-thermal technologies, such as liquid-liquid chromatography and membrane extraction, we create authentic flavour solutions with superior solubility and stability, including those made with our Corefold™ technology.\\n\\n\\nHow do you translate what consumers say they want into tangible flavours?\\n\\n\\nOur research into citrus flavour preferences helps guide and support our customers in developing exemplary citrus sensory experiences. Of the six European countries – the UK, France, Spain, Italy, Germany, and Poland – we surveyed, most European consumers are drawn to citrus’ bright and uplifting qualities\\n. They also tend to enjoy familiar citrus flavours within the region, such as Sicilian lemon, Valencia orange and ruby red grapefruit1. However, these consumers are also interested in expanding their horizons, with curiosity in trying more exotic varietals, such as yuzu, Tahiti lime or key lime\\n.\\n\\n\\nHaving a deep understanding of where the market is heading and developing a set of tools that can support what’s next is vital. Coupling in-depth regional insights with technologies like Corefold™ can unlock the power of citrus.\\n\\n\\nIs it difficult to bridge what’s possible in terms of technology to what consumers want?\\n\\n\\nOur global team of flavourists and food scientists take a collaborative approach to technical development, enabling us to help our customers deliver the true-to-fruit citrus tastes consumers crave. We collaborate with our customers to ideate and develop solutions and products that can overcome potential formulation hurdles.\\n\\n\\nSpecifically, with our Corefold™ technology, we can address the challenges of demanding product bases. Liqueurs, for instance, tend to have bold, powerful flavor experiences. As such, citrus notes must be strong to bring the zing and fruitiness needed.
